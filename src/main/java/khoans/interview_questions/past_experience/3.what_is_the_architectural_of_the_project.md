So regarding the architecture, we will have first client side and the server side. The client side is written in nextjs. And as you know, nextjs is comprise of the react client and the nodejs server. The nodejs server will act as a reverse proxy for the react client. We actually have a custom framework that is a wrapper to the nodejs server of nextjs to provide and extend its functionality by integrating with multiple third parties and multiple services within the system (search service and email lead service, etc). And every requests from the browser to the server side will have to go through the reverse proxy so that we can implement some security features like preventing ddossing or caching. So that's the client side.

The server-side we actually have many services that interacting with the nodejs server, but my responsibility lies mainly on the search service. This service will interact with multiple services to gather the data in order to serve the client side. So, as you can see, it's a microservices architecture. That's the gist of it. The detail is kinda complicated, I could explain more if you want to know about it.
