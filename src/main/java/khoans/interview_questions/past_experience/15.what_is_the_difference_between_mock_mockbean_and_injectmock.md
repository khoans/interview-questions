# What is the difference between @Mock, @MockBean, and @InjectMocks in unit testing frameworks like Mockito and Spring Boot?
In unit testing frameworks like Mockito and Spring Boot, @Mock, @MockBean, and @InjectMocks are annotations used to create and manage mock objects, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.
1. @Mock:
- This annotation is provided by Mockito and is used to create a mock object of a specific class or interface.
- It is typically used in unit tests to simulate the behavior of dependencies that a class under test relies on.
- The mock object created with @Mock does not have any real behavior unless explicitly defined using Mockito's when-then syntax.
- Example usage:
```java
@Mock
private MyService myService;
```
2. @MockBean:
- This annotation is provided by Spring Boot's testing framework and is used to create a mock bean in the Spring application context.
- It is typically used in integration tests or when testing Spring components to replace a real bean with a mock bean.
- The mock bean created with @MockBean is automatically injected into the application context, allowing you to test components that depend on it.
- Example usage:
```java
@MockBean
private MyRepository myRepository;
```
3. @InjectMocks:
- This annotation is provided by Mockito and is used to create an instance of the class under test and inject the mock objects (created with @Mock) into it.
- It is typically used in unit tests to automatically inject the mock dependencies into the class being tested.
- The class under test will have its dependencies replaced with the mock objects, allowing you to isolate the class's behavior.
- Example usage:
```java
@InjectMocks
private MyController myController;
```
In summary, @Mock is used to create mock objects, @MockBean is used to create mock beans in the Spring context, can be used in the @Configuration class, and @InjectMocks is used to inject mock objects into the class under test.
