# Explain the SEO features that you have implemented

So in the current project, I have implemented several SEO features to improve the website's search engine ranking and visibility. Here are some of the key features:
1. Sitemap Generation: I have implemented a dynamic sitemap generator that creates XML sitemaps for the website for various brands using a factory pattern. We deploy a lambda function for each brand that generates the sitemap based on the brand's specific URL structure and content. The sitemaps are then submitted to search engines like Google and Bing to help them crawl and index the website more effectively.
2. URL parser and Validator: I have developed an URL parser and validator to handle different URL formats and ensure that they are SEO-friendly. Solving problems like removing unnecessary parameters, standardizing URL structure, self-correcting common URL mistakes.
3. Implemented automated SEO audits using tools like Lighthouse and Lumars. These audits analyze various SEO aspects of the website, such as page load speed, mobile-friendliness, meta tags, and content quality. The results are then used to identify areas for improvement and implement necessary changes.
4. Integrating with third-party SEO tools for metadata management.
5. Implement an internal linking strategy to improve site navigation and distribute link equity across important pages. This feature is called crawlpath which automatically suggests internal links based on the content of the pages.
6. Optimizing web vital metrics to enhance user experience and search engine rankings. Such metrics like Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), Interaction Next Paint (INP) through code optimizations and lazy loading techniques. We also reduce the size of javascripts to improve page load speed.
