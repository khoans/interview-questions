# What are the types of keys in DynamoDB?

In DynamoDB, there are two main types of keys used to uniquely identify items in a table:

1. Partition Key (also known as Hash Key):
    - The partition key is a single attribute that is used to determine the partition (or physical storage location)
      where the item will be stored. It is mandatory for every DynamoDB table.
    - The partition key must be unique for each item in the table. When you provide a partition key value, DynamoDB uses
      it to compute a hash value, which determines the partition in which the item will be stored.
    - Example: If you have a table of users, the partition key could be "UserID".
    - Example usage:
   ```java
   @DynamoDBTable(tableName = "Users")
   public class User {
       @DynamoDBHashKey(attributeName = "UserID")
       private String userId;
       // other attributes and getters/setters
   }
   ```
    2. Sort Key (also known as Range Key):
        - The sort key is an optional second attribute that, when combined with the partition key, creates a composite
          primary key. This allows for multiple items to have the same partition key value, but different sort key
          values.
        - The sort key is used to sort items within a partition. When querying items, you can specify conditions on the
          sort key to filter results.
        - Example: In the same users table, if you want to store multiple addresses for each user, you could use "
          AddressType" as the sort key.
        - Example usage:
   ```java
      @DynamoDBTable(tableName = "Users")
      public class User {
          @DynamoDBHashKey(attributeName = "UserID")
          private String userId;
            @DynamoDBRangeKey(attributeName = "AddressType")
            private String addressType;
            // other attributes and getters/setters
        }
   ```

In summary, DynamoDB uses partition keys to determine the storage location of items and sort keys to organize items
within a partition. Together, they can form a composite primary key for more complex data modeling.

3. Global Secondary Key (GSI):
    - A global secondary key is an index that allows you to query data using an alternate key, which can be different
      from the primary key (partition key and sort key) of the table.
    - GSIs can have their own partition key and optional sort key, enabling more flexible querying options.
    - Example: If you have a table of orders with "OrderID" as the primary key, you could create a GSI with "CustomerID"
      as the partition key to query all orders for a specific customer.
    - Example usage:
   ```java
   @DynamoDBTable(tableName = "Orders")
   public class Order {
       @DynamoDBHashKey(attributeName = "OrderID")
       private String orderId;
       
       @DynamoDBIndexHashKey(globalSecondaryIndexName = "CustomerIndex", attributeName = "CustomerID")
       private String customerId;
       // other attributes and getters/setters
   }
   ```
