# What is the difference between Dockerfile and Docker Compose in a project?
A Dockerfile and Docker Compose are both tools used in the Docker ecosystem, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts within a project.
1. Dockerfile:
- A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the environment and configuration for a single container.
- The Dockerfile specifies the base image, copies application code, installs dependencies, sets environment variables, exposes ports, and defines the command to run the application.
- It is used to create a custom Docker image that can be run as a container.

2. Docker Compose:
- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (typically named docker-compose.yml) to define the services, networks, and volumes needed for the application.
- Docker Compose allows you to define multiple containers (services) that work together, such as a web application, database, and cache.
- It simplifies the process of starting, stopping, and managing multiple containers with a single command (e.g., docker-compose up).
In summary, a Dockerfile is used to create a single Docker image for a container, while Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers that make up an application.
