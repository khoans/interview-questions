# What is AWS CDK?
AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is an open-source software development framework that allows you to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages such as TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#. It enables developers to model and provision AWS resources using code, making it easier to manage and automate infrastructure deployment. With AWS CDK, you can define your cloud resources as reusable constructs, which can be shared and versioned. This approach promotes best practices, improves maintainability, and enhances collaboration among development teams. AWS CDK also provides a rich library of pre-built constructs for common AWS services, allowing developers to quickly build and deploy cloud applications.
