# How did you access those sensitive information?
To access sensitive information stored in AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, we utilized the AWS SDK within our application. We provide the necessary AWS account credentials which has the appropriate permissions to access these services. The application retrieves the secrets and parameters at runtime, ensuring that sensitive information is not hardcoded or stored in the application's source code or configuration files. This approach enhances security and allows for easier management of sensitive information.
