# Which github actions have you written?
In the current project, I have written a workflow to automated produce a report on SEO metrics using Lumars scan, which is a service that scans websites for SEO issues and provides recommendations for improvement. The workflow is triggered on a schedule basis, so it runs periodically to generate the report.

Beside this, I have written a workflow to swap the production environment configuration based on label applied to the pull request. So that onshore team can test some of the features only available in production environment before merging the code to main branch.

Beside this, I have to write a workflow to integrate lighthouse report generation into our CI/CD pipeline. This workflow runs lighthouse audits on our PR environment and then compare with the master branch to see if there is any regression on performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO scores.
