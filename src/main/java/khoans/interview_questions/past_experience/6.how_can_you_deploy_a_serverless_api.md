# How can you deploy a serverless API in AWS in AWS CDK?

To deploy a serverless API in AWS using AWS CDK, you can follow these steps:
1. Install AWS CDK and set up your development environment.
2. Create a new CDK project using the command `cdk init app --language=<your-preferred-language>`.
3. Define your serverless API using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway in your CDK stack.
4. Use the `aws-lambda` module to create Lambda functions that will handle your API requests.
5. Use the `aws-apigateway` module to create an API Gateway REST API and integrate it with your Lambda functions.
6. Define the necessary routes and methods for your API in the API Gateway.
7. Deploy your CDK stack using the command `cdk deploy`.
8. Once deployed, you can test your serverless API using the endpoint provided by API Gateway.
9. Monitor and manage your API using AWS CloudWatch and other AWS services as needed.
10. Route53 can be used to map a custom domain to your API Gateway endpoint for easier access.
