# What is an API Gateway?
An API Gateway is a server that acts as an intermediary between clients and backend services. It is responsible for routing requests from clients to the appropriate backend services, as well as handling tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, caching, and logging. API Gateways are commonly used in microservices architectures to provide a single entry point for clients to access multiple backend services. They can also help to improve performance and security by offloading tasks from backend services to the gateway.
