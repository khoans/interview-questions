# What Data Framework Did You Use in the Project?
In the project, we actually used Solr search engine, so we have to build our own data framework to interact with Solr. The data framework was responsible to construct Solr queries based on user inputs, send the queries to Solr server, and process the results returned from Solr.

But other services that I have worked on, it's either used Hibernate or JDBC template to interact with relational databases.
