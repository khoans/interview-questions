# How is your approach when migrating from monolith to microservices?

Sometimes we have to create a bridge between the monolith and microservices to ensure smooth communication and data flow. This bridge can be implemented using APIs or messaging systems, allowing the monolith to interact with the microservices without significant changes to its architecture.
For example, we can use RESTful APIs to expose certain functionalities of the microservices, which the monolith can then consume. This approach allows us to gradually transition from the monolith to microservices while maintaining the existing functionality of the application.

Sometimes the migration is pretty straightforward, we just need to identify the components or API endpoints that can be extracted from the monolith and developed as independent microservices. This involves analyzing the monolith's architecture, identifying the boundaries of each service, and designing the microservices accordingly.
Once the microservices are developed, we can deploy them independently and integrate them with the monolith using APIs or messaging systems. This approach allows us to gradually transition from the monolith to microservices while maintaining the existing functionality of the application.
