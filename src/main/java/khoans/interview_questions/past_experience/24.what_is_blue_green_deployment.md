# What is a blue-green deployment?
Blue-green deployment is a software release management strategy that aims to minimize downtime and reduce risks during application updates. In this approach, two identical environments, referred to as "blue" and "green," are maintained. One environment (e.g., blue) is the live production environment serving user traffic, while the other environment (e.g., green) is used for testing and staging the new version of the application.
When a new version of the application is ready for deployment, it is first deployed to the inactive environment (e.g., green). After thorough testing and validation, traffic is switched from the active environment (blue) to the newly updated environment (green). This switch can be done using load balancers or DNS updates.
If any issues arise after the switch, it is easy to roll back to the previous version by redirecting traffic back to the original environment (blue). This approach allows for seamless transitions between application versions, minimizes downtime, and reduces the risk of deployment failures.
Blue-green deployment is particularly useful in scenarios where high availability and reliability are critical, such as in web applications and services. It allows for quick recovery from potential issues and provides a safe way to test new features before they are fully rolled out to users.
