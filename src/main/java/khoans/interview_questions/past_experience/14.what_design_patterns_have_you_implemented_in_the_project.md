# What design patterns have you implemented in the project?
I will list some of the design patterns that I have implemented in the project:
1. Singleton Pattern: So i have used singleton pattern to ensure that a class only has one instance to access a shared resource, such as s3 client or database connection pool.
2. Abstract factory pattern: I have used abstract factory pattern to generate sitemaps for different clients by creating generator factories that produce sitemap generators based on client-specific requirements.
3. Strategy Pattern: I have used strategy pattern to implement different validator strategies for URL validation based on different client requirements.
4. Factory Method Pattern: I have used factory method pattern to create different types of reports based on the brand
