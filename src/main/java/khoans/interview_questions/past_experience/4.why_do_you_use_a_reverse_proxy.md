Well, we use the reverse proxy to interact with the spring boot services because we don't want browser to interact with those services directly. We want to implement security features and the reverse proxy can act as a gateway to those services. We can implement rate limiter, or circuit breaker on each request, and implement caching mechanism for each request so that when the search service is down, we still have the cache as the fallback.
