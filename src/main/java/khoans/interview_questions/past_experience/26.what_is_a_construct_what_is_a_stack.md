# What is a construct? What is a stack?
In AWS CDK, a construct is the basic building block of AWS infrastructure. It is an abstraction that represents a cloud resource or a group of resources. Constructs can be simple, such as an individual AWS service like an S3 bucket or a Lambda function, or they can be complex, combining multiple resources to create higher-level abstractions. Constructs are defined using programming languages supported by AWS CDK, allowing developers to use familiar coding patterns and practices to define their infrastructure.
A stack, on the other hand, is a collection of AWS resources that are defined and managed as a single unit. In AWS CDK, a stack is represented by the `Stack` class, which serves as a container for constructs. When you deploy a stack, AWS CDK translates the constructs defined in the stack into AWS CloudFormation templates, which are then used to create and manage the actual AWS resources in your account. Stacks provide a way to organize and manage related resources together, making it easier to deploy, update, and delete them as needed.
In summary, a construct is an individual building block that represents a cloud resource or a group of resources, while a stack is a collection of constructs that are managed as a single unit in AWS CDK.
