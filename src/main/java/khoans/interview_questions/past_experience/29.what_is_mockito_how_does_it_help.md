# What is mockito and how does it help?
Mockito is a popular mocking framework for Java that allows developers to create mock objects for unit testing. It helps in isolating the class under test by simulating the behavior of its dependencies, enabling developers to focus on testing the functionality of the class itself without being affected by the behavior of its dependencies. Mockito provides a simple and intuitive API for creating mock objects, defining their behavior, and verifying interactions with them. This leads to more effective and efficient unit tests, as it allows for better control over the test environment and helps in identifying issues in the code more easily. Overall, Mockito enhances the quality of unit tests and contributes to more maintainable and reliable code.
