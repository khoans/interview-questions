# What is the difference between API Gateway and Load Balancer?
In cloud computing, both API Gateway and Load Balancer are used to manage and distribute incoming traffic to backend services, but they serve different purposes and operate at different layers of the network stack.
1. API Gateway:
- An API Gateway is a server that acts as an intermediary between clients and backend services, specifically designed to handle API requests.
- It operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model and is responsible for routing, request transformation, authentication, rate limiting, caching, and monitoring of API calls.
- API Gateways are commonly used in microservices architectures to provide a unified entry point for multiple services, allowing clients to interact with various backend services through a single API endpoint.o- Example services: AWS API Gateway, Kong, Apigee.
- Use cases: Exposing RESTful APIs, handling API versioning, implementing security policies for APIs.
2. Load Balancer:
- A Load Balancer is a device or service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure high availability and reliability of applications.
- It can operate at different layers of the OSI model, including the transport layer (Layer 4) and the application layer (Layer 7).
- Load Balancers are used to balance the load of incoming requests, improve fault tolerance, and optimize resource utilization by directing traffic to healthy servers.
- Example services: AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), NGINX, HAProxy.
- Use cases: Distributing web traffic across multiple web servers, ensuring high availability of applications, and managing SSL termination.
In summary, while both API Gateways and Load Balancers are used to manage incoming traffic, API Gateways are specifically designed for handling API requests and providing additional functionalities related to APIs, whereas Load Balancers focus on distributing network traffic to ensure application availability and performance.
