I will try to explain in short:
1. First, we will have the environment set up step: We have different configuration for different environment right? Most notably production and non-production.
2. Second, we will have the ci/cd pipeline preparation, for example:
- we will have to install maven, jdk for building the spring boot application
- we will have to checkout the code from the repository
- we will have establish a secure access to aws
- and then login into ecr.

3. Then we will have to build and push the docker image to ecr
4. and then we deploy to ElasticBeanstalk using elasticbeanstalk cli. Then elasticbeanstalk will pull the docker image from the ecr and launches it on ec2 instances within the environment.
5. And to ensure zero downtime and have an easier rollback strategy, we use blue-green deployment where we have identical environment with the same configuration with the production one. We will deploy the application to the green environment and then monitor the error rate after shifting some of the traffic from blue to green and checking the health of the green environemnt.
6. If everything is ok, we perform a CNAME swap using ElasticBeanstalk's 'Swap environment URLs' feature, which instantly redirects traffic from blue to green
7. If the error gone up, we will perform rollback by swapping back to the old version.
