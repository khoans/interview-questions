1. My current project is an marketplace where dealers or individual sellers that want to list their vehicles into the site. And then the end-customer will visit the site and choose which vehicle that they want to buy or continue processing. It's a very large project with multiple components involved to make that site functional including financial tools, price calculator, seo features, search service or lead service, etc.

2. My main responsibility is involving working with the search service by providing apis for the site to consume, not just the site but also other services to consume as well. And the other responsibility is the client side of the webpage, along with multiple components that contribute to the functionality of the site which I will explain more in detail if you ask.
