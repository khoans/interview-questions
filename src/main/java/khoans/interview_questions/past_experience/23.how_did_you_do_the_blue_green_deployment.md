# How did you do the blue-green deployment?
In our project, we implemented blue-green deployment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. We set up two separate environments: the blue environment, which is the currently live production environment, and the green environment, which is the new version of the application that we want to deploy.
When we were ready to deploy a new version of the application, we first deployed it to the green environment. We thoroughly tested the green environment to ensure that everything was functioning correctly and that there were no issues. We also shifted a small portion of the traffic to the green environment to monitor its performance and stability.
Once we were confident that the green environment was stable and performing well, we switched the traffic from the blue environment to the green environment. This switch was done using Elastic Beanstalk's built-in functionality, which allowed us to seamlessly redirect traffic without any downtime.
After the switch, we continued to monitor the green environment to ensure that it was handling the traffic properly. If any issues arose, we could easily roll back to the blue environment by redirecting the traffic back to it.
Overall, using AWS Elastic Beanstalk for blue-green deployment allowed us to minimize downtime, reduce the risk of deployment failures, and ensure a smooth transition between application versions.
