# What is the hardest feature that you have implemented?

The hardest feature I have implemented was a parser, validator and self-corrector for urls in a large-scale web application to conform to SEO best practices.

So to explain the problem that we were trying to solve, how would you implement a filter in the url? Maybe we'll use query parameters, like ?color=red&size=large. But the problem with that approach is that search engines don't like query parameters, and it could hurt SEO rankings and exhaust crawl budgets. Because ?color=red&size=large could be seen as a different page than ?size=large&color=red, leading to duplicate content issues. Now that is just two parameters, but imagine if you had around 40-50 parameters, the permutations would be enormous, leading to a massive number of duplicate pages. That's what we were facing.
=> To combat this, we decided to implement a URL structure that used path segments instead of query parameters. This way we could have URLs like /product/red/large. This structure is much more SEO-friendly and easier for search engines to crawl and index. And to deal with this problem is very challenging because we had to consider various factors such as path segment ordering, optional parameters, and we had to deal with different branding requirements for different clients.
