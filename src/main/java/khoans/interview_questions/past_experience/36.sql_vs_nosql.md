# SQL database vs NoSQL databse
- SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. They stored data in tabular form with rows and columns, and enforce a predefined schema. SQL databases are suitable for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and data integrity. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
- NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not use SQL for data manipulation. They can store data in various formats such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores. NoSQL databases are designed for scalability, flexibility, and high performance, making them suitable for applications with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.
