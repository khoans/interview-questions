# How do you access secrets/variables in GitHub Actions?
In GitHub Actions, you can access secrets and variables using the `secrets` and `env` contexts, respectively. Here's how you can do it:
1. **Accessing Secrets**:
   - Secrets are sensitive information such as API keys, tokens, or passwords that you want to keep secure. You can store secrets in your GitHub repository settings under "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
   - To access a secret in your workflow, you can use the `secrets` context. For example, if you have a secret named `MY_SECRET`, you can access it like this:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Use secret
           run: echo "My secret is ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}"
   ```
2. **Accessing Variables**:
   - Variables are non-sensitive information that you can also store in your repository settings under "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
   - To access a variable in your workflow, you can use the `env` context. For example, if you have a variable named `MY_VARIABLE`, you can access it like this:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Use variable
           run: echo "My variable is ${{ env.MY_VARIABLE }}"
   ```
By using the `secrets` and `env` contexts, you can securely access sensitive information

We can also use github actions to access the aws secrets manager and aws ssm parameter store to retrieve sensitive information at runtime without hardcoding them in the workflow file. and non-sensitive information in your GitHub Actions workflows. For example, we have a custom script that will retrieve sensitive information from AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and set them as environment variables for use in subsequent steps of the workflow. We will only have to provide the necessary AWS credentials with appropriate permissions to access these services.
