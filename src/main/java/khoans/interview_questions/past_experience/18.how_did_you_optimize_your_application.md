# How did you optimize your application?
There are several ways we optimized our application to improve performance and reduce resource consumption:
1. Caching: we implemented ehcache to cache frequently accessed data, reducing the need for repeated database queries and improving response times.
2. Beside that, in the reverse proxy layer, we used Akamai to cache static content, Elasticache to cache some dynamic content, and in the reverse proxy itself we also implemented caching for certain API responses to reduce latency and improve performance.
3. We monitored and analyzed each API endpoint's performance via NewRelic. This helped us identify bottlenecks and optimize slow-performing endpoints by optimizing database queries, improving code efficiency, or implementing pagination for large datasets.
4. For services that uses relational databases, we optimized database performance by creating appropriate indexes, optimizing queries, and using connection pooling to reduce latency and improve throughput.
5. We also optimized resource usage by right-sizing our AWS infrastructure, using auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes, some critical services were over-provisioned to ensure high availability and performance.
6. Finally, we continuously monitored application performance using tools like NewRelic and AWS CloudWatch to identify areas for improvement and implement optimizations as needed.
7. Some of the APIs were migrated to serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to reduce infrastructure management overhead and improve scalability. It also reduced costs as we only paid for the actual usage of the APIs.
8. For third party API calls, to prevent overwhelming the third party services, we implemented rate limiting and retries with exponential backoff. Some APIs that were not frequently changed were cached in Elasticache or reverse proxy layer to reduce the number of calls to the third party services.
Overall, these optimizations helped improve application performance, reduce latency, and enhance the user experience.
