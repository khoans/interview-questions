# Why did you choose memcached over Redis?

When deciding between Memcached and Redis for a caching solution, several factors influenced my choice of Memcached:
1. Simplicity: Memcached is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It has a straightforward key-value store model, making it easy to implement and manage. For our use case, we needed a simple caching solution without the additional features that Redis offers.
2. Performance: Memcached is designed for high-performance caching and can handle a large number of concurrent connections with low latency. In scenarios where we required fast read and write operations, Memcached proved to be an efficient choice.
3. Memory Efficiency: Memcached uses a slab allocation mechanism that helps reduce memory fragmentation. This is particularly beneficial when caching small objects, as it optimizes memory usage and improves performance.
4. Use Case: Our caching requirements were primarily focused on storing simple key-value pairs without the need for advanced data structures or features like persistence, pub/sub, or Lua scripting that Redis provides. Memcached was sufficient for our needs.
5. Community and Ecosystem: Memcached has a mature ecosystem with a wide range of client libraries available for various programming languages. This made it easy to integrate Memcached into our existing technology stack.
Overall, while Redis offers a rich set of features, Memcached was a better fit for our specific caching needs due to its simplicity, performance, and memory efficiency.
