# How did you protect sensitive information in your application?
So in our project, sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. 

As for the database password credentials, we use jscrypt to hash the password before storing it in the application configuration files. This ways, when we started the application, we have to provide the decryption key to decrypt the password before using it to connect to the database.
