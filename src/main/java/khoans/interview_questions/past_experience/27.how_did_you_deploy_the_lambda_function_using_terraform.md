# How did you deploy the lambda function using Terraform?
In some of the older lambda functions, we used Terraform to deploy them. Here are the steps we followed:
1. **Set Up Terraform**: We installed Terraform on our local machine and configured it with our AWS credentials.
2. **Create a Terraform Configuration File**: We created a bunch of `.tf` files to define the infrastructure like the event bridge, lambda function, iam, and other necessary resources.
3. After defining the resources for multiple environments like prod and non-prod. We have a bash script that will take in the environemtn as an argument and set the appropriate backend configuration for terraform state file. This script will also initialize the terraform working directory using `terraform init` command.
4. **Plan the Deployment**: We ran `terraform plan` to see the changes that would be made to our AWS infrastructure.
5. **Apply the Changes**: We executed `terraform apply` to create or update the resources defined in our configuration files.
6. **Verify the Deployment**: After the deployment, we verified that the lambda function and other resources were created successfully in the AWS Management Console.
7. The whole process was automated using github actions so that whenever there is a new change to the terraform files, the pipeline will automatically run the bash script to deploy the changes to the specified environment.
