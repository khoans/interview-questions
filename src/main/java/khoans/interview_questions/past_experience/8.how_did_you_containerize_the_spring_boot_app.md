# How did you containerize the Spring Boot app?
First, we use shade maven plugin to create a fat jar that contains all the dependencies needed to run the Spring Boot application. This makes it easier to deploy and run the application in a containerized environment.
Here is a sample Dockerfile that we used to containerize the Spring Boot app:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app
# Copy the fat jar file into the container at /app
COPY target/my-spring-boot-app.jar app.jar
# Expose the port that the Spring Boot app will run on
EXPOSE 8080
# Define the command to run the Spring Boot app
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```
