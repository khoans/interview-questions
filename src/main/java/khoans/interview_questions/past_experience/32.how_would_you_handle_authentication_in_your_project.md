# How would you handle authentication in your project?
In our project, we have a reverse proxy server that handles authentication by checking the user's credentials from AWS Cognito user pool. When a user tries to access our application, the reverse proxy server intercepts the request and verifies the user's identity against the Cognito user pool. If the credentials are valid, the request is forwarded to the application server; otherwise, access is denied. This approach ensures that only authenticated users can access our application, enhancing security and user management.
