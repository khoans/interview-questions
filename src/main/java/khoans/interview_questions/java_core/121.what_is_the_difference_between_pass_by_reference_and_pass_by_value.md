# What is the difference between pass by reference and pass by value?
In programming, "pass by reference" and "pass by value" are two different methods of passing arguments to functions or methods. The key difference between the two lies in how the data is passed and how changes to the data within the function affect the original data.
1. **Pass by Value**:
   - In pass by value, a copy of the actual value of the argument is passed to the function. This means that any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original argument outside the function.
   - Example in Java (which uses pass by value for primitive types):
     ```java
     public void modifyValue(int num) {
         num = 10; // This change does not affect the original variable
     }

     int original = 5;
     modifyValue(original);
     // original is still 5
     ```
2. **Pass by Reference**:
   - In pass by reference, a reference (or address) to the actual data is passed to the function. This means that changes made to the parameter inside the function will affect the original argument outside the function.
   - Example in languages that support pass by reference (like Java)
   - (Java uses pass by value for object references, which can sometimes be confused with pass by reference):
     ```java
     public void modifyObject(MyObject obj) {
         obj.value = 10; // This change affects the original object
     }

     MyObject originalObj = new MyObject();
     originalObj.value = 5;
     modifyObject(originalObj);
     // originalObj.value is now 10
     ```
     
In summary, pass by value involves passing a copy of the data, while pass by reference involves passing a reference to the actual data. Changes made to parameters in pass by value do not affect the original data, whereas changes made in pass by reference do affect the original data.
