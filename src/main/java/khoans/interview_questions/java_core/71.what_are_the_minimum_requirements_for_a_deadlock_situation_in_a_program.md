# What is the minimum requirements for a deadlock situation in a program?
A deadlock situation in a program occurs when two or more threads are unable to proceed because each thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread. The minimum requirements for a deadlock situation to occur are as follows:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode, meaning that only one thread can use the resource at any given time. If another thread requests that resource, it must wait until the resource is released.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A thread must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other threads.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread holding them. A resource can only be released voluntarily by the thread that is holding it.
4. **Circular Wait**: There must be a circular chain of two or more threads, where each thread is waiting for a resource that is held by the next thread in the chain. This creates a cycle of dependencies that prevents any of the threads from proceeding.
When all four of these conditions are met simultaneously, a deadlock situation can occur, leading to a standstill in the program's execution.
