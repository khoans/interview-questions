# Difference between a hashmap and hashtable in Java
HashMap and Hashtable are both implementations of the Map interface in Java, but they have several key differences:
1. **Synchronization**:
   - Hashtable is synchronized, meaning it is thread-safe and can be used in a multi-threaded environment without additional synchronization.
   - HashMap is not synchronized, making it faster than Hashtable in single-threaded scenarios but not thread-safe.
2. **Null Keys and Values**:
   - Hashtable does not allow null keys or null values. Attempting to insert a null key or value will result in a NullPointerException.
   - HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
3. **Performance**:
   - Due to the synchronization overhead, Hashtable is generally slower than HashMap when used in a single-threaded context.
   - HashMap is faster and more efficient for single-threaded operations.
4. **Legacy**:
   - Hashtable is considered a legacy class and has been part of Java since JDK 1.0.
   - HashMap was introduced in JDK 1.2 as part of the Java Collections Framework.
5. **Iteration**:
   - The iterator of HashMap is fail-fast, meaning it will throw a ConcurrentModificationException if the map is modified while iterating.
   - The enumerator of Hashtable is not fail-fast.
In summary, choose Hashtable for thread-safe operations and HashMap for better performance in single-threaded contexts.
