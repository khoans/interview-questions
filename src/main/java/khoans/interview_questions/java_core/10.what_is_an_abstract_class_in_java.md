# What is an abstract class in Java?
An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain both abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods (methods with a body). Abstract classes are used to provide a common base for related classes, allowing them to share code and define a common interface.
