# Explain hashCode() and equals() in Java
In Java, `hashCode()` and `equals()` are two important methods that are used to determine the equality of objects and to manage them in hash-based collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `Hashtable`.
1. `equals()` Method:
- The `equals()` method is used to compare two objects for equality. By default, the `equals()` method in the `Object` class compares the memory addresses of the objects, which means it checks if they are the same instance.
- To compare the actual content of the objects, you need to override the `equals()` method in your class to provide a custom implementation that compares the relevant fields of the objects.

2. `hashCode()` Method:
- The `hashCode()` method returns an integer value (hash code) that represents the object's memory address by default. This hash code is used by hash-based collections to efficiently store and retrieve objects.
- When you override the `equals()` method, it is essential to also override the `hashCode()` method to ensure that equal objects produce the same hash code. This is important for maintaining the contract between `equals()` and `hashCode()`, which states that if two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, they must have the same hash code.
