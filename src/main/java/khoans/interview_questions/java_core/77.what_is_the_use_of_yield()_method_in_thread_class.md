# What is the use of yield() method in Thread class?
The `yield()` method in the `Thread` class is a static method that is used to suggest to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of the CPU. When a thread calls `Thread.yield()`, it indicates that it is willing to pause its execution temporarily to allow other threads of the same priority to execute. The main purposes of the `yield()` method are:
1. **Improving Thread Scheduling**: By yielding, a thread can give other threads of the same priority a chance to run, which can help improve the overall responsiveness and fairness of thread scheduling.
2. **Reducing CPU Usage**: In scenarios where a thread is performing a busy-wait (e.g., waiting for a condition to change), calling `yield()` can help reduce CPU usage by allowing other threads to execute instead of continuously consuming CPU cycles.
3. **Cooperative Multitasking**: In cooperative multitasking environments, threads can use `yield()` to voluntarily give up control of the CPU, allowing other threads to run and promoting better multitasking.
It's important to note that the `yield()` method is merely a hint to the thread scheduler, and there is no guarantee that the current thread will actually yield or that other threads will be scheduled to run immediately. The behavior of `yield()` can vary depending on the underlying operating system and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation.
