# How do find which client machine is sending request to your servlet in Java?
You can find out which client machine is sending a request to your servlet in Java by using the `HttpServletRequest` object that is passed to the servlet's `doGet` or `doPost` methods. The `HttpServletRequest` object provides methods to retrieve information about the client making the request. Here are some common methods you can use:

1. **getRemoteAddr()**: This method returns the IP address of the client that sent the request.

```java
String clientIpAddress = request.getRemoteAddr();
System.out.println("Client IP Address: " + clientIpAddress);
```

2. **getRemoteHost()**: This method returns the hostname of the client that sent the request. Note that this may involve a DNS lookup, which can be slower than getting the IP address.

```java
String clientHostName = request.getRemoteHost();
System.out.println("Client Host Name: " + clientHostName);
```

3. **getHeader(String name)**: You can also retrieve specific headers sent by the client, such as the "User-Agent" header, which provides information about the client's browser or application.

```java
String userAgent = request.getHeader("User-Agent");
System.out.println("Client User-Agent: " + userAgent);
```

Here is an example of a servlet that uses these methods to log the client information:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

public class ClientInfoServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String clientIpAddress = request.getRemoteAddr();
        String clientHostName = request.getRemoteHost();
        String userAgent = request.getHeader("User-Agent");

        response.setContentType("text/plain");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println("Client IP Address: " + clientIpAddress);
        out.println("Client Host Name: " + clientHostName);
        out.println("Client User-Agent: " + userAgent);
    }
}
```
