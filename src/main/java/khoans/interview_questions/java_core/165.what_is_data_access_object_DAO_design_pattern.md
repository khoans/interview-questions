# What is DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern?
The Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides an abstract interface to a database or other persistence mechanism. The DAO pattern separates the data access logic from the business logic of an application, allowing for better modularity, maintainability, and testability.


In the DAO pattern, a DAO class is responsible for encapsulating all the interactions with the data source, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. The business logic layer interacts with the DAO layer to perform these operations without needing to know the details of how the data is stored or retrieved.
