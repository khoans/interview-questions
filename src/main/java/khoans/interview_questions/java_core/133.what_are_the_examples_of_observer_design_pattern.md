# What are the examples of Observer Design Pattern?
The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing multiple observer objects to be notified and updated automatically when the state of a subject object changes. Here are some common examples of the Observer Design Pattern:

1. **Event Listeners in GUI Frameworks**:
   - In graphical user interfaces (GUIs), event listeners are a classic example of the Observer pattern. For instance, in Java's Swing framework, components like buttons can have multiple listeners (observers) that respond to events such as clicks or key presses.

2. **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture**:
   - In the MVC architecture, the model (subject) maintains the data and notifies the views (observers) whenever there is a change in the data. This allows the views to update themselves automatically based on the model's state.

3. **Publish-Subscribe Systems**:
   - In publish-subscribe messaging systems, publishers (subjects) send messages to multiple subscribers (observers) who have expressed interest in receiving those messages. Examples include message brokers like Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ.

4. **Social Media Notifications**:
   - Social media platforms often use the Observer pattern to notify users (observers) about updates from their friends or followed accounts (subjects). When a user posts new content, all their followers are notified.

5. **Stock Market Tickers**:
   - Stock market applications use the Observer pattern to update stock prices in real-time. When the price of a stock (subject) changes, all registered clients (observers) receive the updated price information.

6. **Weather Monitoring Systems**:
   - Weather monitoring applications use the Observer pattern to notify various display units (observers) about changes in weather conditions (subject). When the weather data is updated, all display units reflect the new information.
