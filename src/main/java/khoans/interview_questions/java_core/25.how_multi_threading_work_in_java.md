# How multi-threading works in Java?
Multi-threading in Java is a programming concept that allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single program. A thread is a lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system. Java provides built-in support for multi-threading through the `java.lang.Thread` class and the `java.lang.Runnable` interface.
