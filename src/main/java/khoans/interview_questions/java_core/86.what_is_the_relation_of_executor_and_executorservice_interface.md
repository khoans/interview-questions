# What is the relation of Executor and ExecutorService interface?
The `Executor` and `ExecutorService` interfaces are both part of the Java Concurrency framework and are used for managing and executing tasks in a multi-threaded environment. However, they serve different purposes and have different levels of functionality.
1. **Executor Interface**: The `Executor` interface is a simple interface that defines a single method, `execute(Runnable command)`, which is used to submit tasks for execution. It provides a way to decouple task submission from the actual execution of the task. The `Executor` interface does not provide any additional functionality for managing the lifecycle of tasks or threads.
2. **ExecutorService Interface**: The `ExecutorService` interface extends the `Executor` interface and provides a more comprehensive set of methods for managing and controlling the execution of tasks. It includes methods for submitting tasks, shutting down the executor, and managing the lifecycle of tasks. Some of the key methods in the `ExecutorService` interface include:
   - `submit(Callable<T> task)`: Submits a task for execution and returns a `Future` representing the result of the task.
   - `shutdown()`: Initiates an orderly shutdown of the executor, allowing previously submitted tasks to complete.
   - `shutdownNow()`: Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks and halts the processing of waiting tasks.
   - `invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks)`: Submits a collection of tasks for execution and returns a list of `Future` objects representing the results.
In summary, the `Executor` interface provides a basic mechanism for executing tasks, while the `ExecutorService` interface builds upon it by offering additional functionality for task management and lifecycle control. The `ExecutorService` is more commonly used in real-world applications due to its enhanced capabilities.
