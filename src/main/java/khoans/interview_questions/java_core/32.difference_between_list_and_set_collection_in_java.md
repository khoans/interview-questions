# Difference Between List and Set Collection in Java

In Java, both List and Set are interfaces that extend the Collection interface, but they have different characteristics
and behaviors. Here are the key differences between List and Set:

1. **Order**:
    - List: Maintains the order of elements based on their insertion order. Elements can be accessed by their index.
    - Set: Does not guarantee any specific order of elements. The order may vary depending on the implementation (e.g.,
      HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

2. **Duplicates**:
    - List: Allows duplicate elements. You can have multiple occurrences of the same element in a List.
    - Set: Does not allow duplicate elements. Each element must be unique within a Set

3. **Implementation Classes**:
    - List: Common implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.
    - Set: Common implementations include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

4. **Accessing Elements**:
    - List: Elements can be accessed using their index (e.g., list.get(index)).
    - Set: Elements cannot be accessed by index. You typically iterate over the elements using an iterator or enhanced
      for loop.

5. **Performance**:
    - List: Generally provides faster access to elements by index, but may have slower performance for certain
      operations like searching for an element.
    - Set: Generally provides faster performance for operations like searching for an element, especially in HashSet,
      but may have slower performance for adding elements due to the need to check for duplicates.
