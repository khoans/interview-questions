# What is a functional interface in Java 8?
A functional interface in Java 8 is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. This single abstract method defines the contract for the functional interface, allowing it to be used as the target for lambda expressions and method references. Functional interfaces are a key feature of Java 8, enabling functional programming concepts within the Java language.

To declare a functional interface, you can use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation, which is optional but helps to ensure that the interface adheres to the functional interface contract. If the interface contains more than one abstract method, the compiler will generate an error when this annotation is present.
Here is an example of a functional interface in Java 8:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void execute(); // Single abstract method
}
```

In this example, `MyFunctionalInterface` is a functional interface with a single abstract method `execute()`. You can implement this interface using a lambda expression as follows:

```java
public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using a lambda expression to implement the functional interface
        MyFunctionalInterface myFunc = () -> System.out.println("Executing the functional interface method!");
        myFunc.execute(); // Output: Executing the functional interface method!
    }
}
```
