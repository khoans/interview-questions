# What is a repository pattern?
The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that provides a centralized and abstract way to manage data access and storage operations in an application. It acts as a mediator between the domain and data mapping layers, allowing for a clean separation of concerns. The main purpose of the Repository Pattern is to encapsulate the logic for accessing data sources, such as databases, web services, or in-memory collections, and to provide a consistent interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.


Here are some key characteristics of the Repository Pattern:
1. **Abstraction**: The Repository Pattern abstracts the data access logic from the business logic, allowing developers to work with domain objects without needing to understand the underlying data storage mechanisms.
2. **Centralized Data Access**: It provides a single point of access for data operations, making it easier to manage and maintain data access code.
3. **Decoupling**: By using repositories, the application becomes less dependent on specific data storage technologies, making it easier to switch between different data sources if needed.
4. **Testability**: The Repository Pattern facilitates unit testing by allowing developers to mock or stub the repository interfaces, enabling isolated testing of business logic without relying on actual data sources.
5. **Consistency**: It promotes a consistent way of accessing and manipulating data across the application.


# Difference between Repository Pattern and DAO Pattern
While both the Repository Pattern and the Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern are used to manage data access, they have some differences in their focus and implementation:
1. **Focus**:
   - Repository Pattern: Focuses on the domain model and provides a higher-level abstraction for managing domain objects. It often works with aggregates and encapsulates business logic related to data access.
   - DAO Pattern: Focuses on the data source and provides a lower-level abstraction for accessing data. It typically deals with individual entities and their persistence.
2. **Abstraction Level**:
   - Repository Pattern: Operates at a higher level of abstraction, often dealing with collections of domain objects and their relationships.
   - DAO Pattern: Operates at a lower level of abstraction, dealing with individual database operations for specific entities.
3. **Business Logic**:
   - Repository Pattern: May include business logic related to data access, such as validation or transformation of data before returning it to the domain layer.
   - DAO Pattern: Primarily focuses on data access operations without incorporating business logic.
4. **Usage**:
   - Repository Pattern: Used in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and is often part of the domain layer.
   - DAO Pattern: Used in traditional applications and is often part of the data access layer.
In summary, the Repository Pattern provides a higher-level abstraction for managing domain objects and their relationships, while the DAO Pattern focuses on low-level data access operations for individual entities.
