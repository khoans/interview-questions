# What are the differences between Collection and Stream API in Java?
The Collection framework and Stream API in Java are both used for handling groups of objects, but they have different purposes and functionalities. Here are the key differences between the two:
1. **Purpose**:
   - **Collection**: The Collection framework is primarily used for storing, retrieving, and manipulating groups of objects. It provides data structures like lists, sets, and maps to manage collections of elements.
   - **Stream API**: The Stream API is designed for processing sequences of elements in a functional style. It allows for operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing data in a declarative manner.
2. **Data Storage**:
   - **Collection**: Collections are data structures that store elements in memory. They can be modified (mutable) or unmodifiable (immutable).
   - **Stream API**: Streams do not store data; instead, they provide a view of a sequence of elements from a source (like a collection, array, or I/O channel) and allow for processing those elements.
3. **Mutability**:
   - **Collection**: Collections can be mutable, meaning you can add, remove , or modify elements in the collection.
   - **Stream API**: Streams are immutable; once created, they cannot be modified. Any operation on a stream produces a new stream.
4. **Processing**:
   - **Collection**: Operations on collections are typically performed using loops or iterators, which can be imperative in nature.
   - **Stream API**: The Stream API supports functional-style operations, allowing for more concise and expressive code using lambda expressions and method references.
5. **Lazy Evaluation**:
   - **Collection**: Operations on collections are eager, meaning they are executed immediately when called.
   - **Stream API**: Streams support lazy evaluation, meaning that operations are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked. This allows for optimization and efficient processing.
6. **Parallel Processing**:
   - **Collection**: Collections do not inherently support parallel processing. You would need to manage threading manually.
   - **Stream API**: The Stream API provides built-in support for parallel processing through the `parallelStream()` method, allowing for easy parallelization of operations.
7. **Terminal and Intermediate Operations**:
   - **Collection**: Collections do not have the concept of terminal and intermediate operations.
   - **Stream API**: Streams have intermediate operations (like `filter`, `map`) that return a new stream and terminal operations (like `collect`, `forEach`) that produce a result or side effect.
In summary, while both the Collection framework and Stream API are used to work with groups of objects in Java, collections focus on data storage and manipulation, whereas streams focus on data processing in a functional and declarative manner.
