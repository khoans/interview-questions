# What are the main differences between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap in Java?
HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap are both implementations of the Map interface in Java, but they have significant differences in terms of concurrency and performance. Here are the main differences between them:

1. **Thread Safety**:
   - **HashMap**: It is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a HashMap concurrently and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally.
   - **ConcurrentHashMap**: It is designed for concurrent access and is thread-safe. Multiple threads can read and write to the map simultaneously without the need for external synchronization.

2. **Locking Mechanism**:
   - **HashMap**: When synchronized externally, it typically uses a single lock for the entire map, which can lead to contention and reduced performance in multi-threaded environments.
   - **ConcurrentHashMap**: It uses a finer-grained locking mechanism called lock striping. The map is divided into segments, and each segment can be locked independently, allowing higher concurrency and better performance.

3. **Null Values**:
   - **HashMap**: It allows one null key and multiple null values.
   - **ConcurrentHashMap**: It does not allow null keys or null values. Attempting to insert a null key or value will result in a NullPointerException.

4. **Performance**:
   - **HashMap**: It generally provides better performance in single-threaded scenarios due to its simpler implementation.
   - **ConcurrentHashMap**: It is optimized for concurrent access and provides better performance in multi-threaded scenarios, especially when there are frequent read and write operations.

5. **Iteration**:
   - **HashMap**: The iterator is fail-fast, meaning that if the map is modified after the iterator is created (except through the iterator's own remove method), it will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
   - **ConcurrentHashMap**: The iterator is weakly consistent, meaning that it reflects the state of the map at some point during or after the iterator's creation, and it does not throw ConcurrentModificationException.

In summary, use HashMap for single-threaded applications or when external synchronization is manageable, and use ConcurrentHashMap for multi-threaded applications where high concurrency and thread safety are required.
