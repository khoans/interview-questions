# How can we share an object between multiple threads?
In Java, you can share an object between multiple threads by ensuring that the object is accessible to all the threads that need to use it. Here are some common ways to share an object between multiple threads:
1. **Using a Shared Object Reference**:
   You can create an object and pass its reference to multiple threads. Each thread can then access and modify the shared object.

   ```java
   public class SharedObjectExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

           Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
               resource.increment();
           });

           Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
               resource.increment();
           });

           t1.start();
           t2.start();
       }
   }

   class SharedResource {
       private int count = 0;

       public synchronized void increment() {
           count++;
           System.out.println("Count: " + count);
       }
   }
   ```
   
2. **Using Static Variables**:

    You can use static variables to share data between threads. Static variables belong to the class rather than any specific instance, so all threads can access the same static variable.
    
    ```java
    public class StaticVariableExample {
         private static int count = 0;
    
         public static synchronized void increment() {
              count++;
              System.out.println("Count: " + count);
         }
    
         public static void main(String[] args) {
              Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                increment();
              });
    
              Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
                increment();
              });
    
              t1.start();
              t2.start();
         }
    }
    ```
   

3. **Using Thread-safe Collections**:

    Java provides thread-safe collections in the `java.util.concurrent` package, such as `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, etc. These collections can be safely shared between multiple threads without additional synchronization.
    
    ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
    
    public class ThreadSafeCollectionExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
              ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    
              Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                map.put("A", 1);
              });
    
              Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
                map.put("B", 2);
              });
    
              t1.start();
              t2.start();
         }
    }
    ```
   

4. **Using `ThreadLocal`**:

    If you want to share an object between threads but keep it isolated for each thread, you can use `ThreadLocal`. Each thread will have its own instance of the object.
    
    ```java
    public class ThreadLocalExample {
         private static ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalCount = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);
    
         public static void main(String[] args) {
              Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                int count = threadLocalCount.get();
                count++;
                threadLocalCount.set(count);
                System.out.println("Thread 1 Count: " + threadLocalCount.get());
              });
    
              Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
                int count = threadLocalCount.get();
                count++;
                threadLocalCount.set(count);
                System.out.println("Thread 2 Count: " + threadLocalCount.get());
              });
    
              t1.start();
              t2.start();
         }
    }
    ```
   
When sharing objects between multiple threads, it's important to consider thread safety and synchronization to avoid issues such as race conditions and data inconsistency. Using synchronized methods, blocks, or thread-safe collections can help ensure that shared objects are accessed safely.
