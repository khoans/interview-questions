# Main Principles of OOP

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and methods within a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to an object's data and methods, allowing controlled access through access modifiers like private, protected and public. This helps to maintain data integrity and prevents unintended interference from outside code.

- public: accessible from anywhere
- private: accessible only within the class
- protected: accessible within the class and its subclasses
- default (package-private): accessible within the same package, but not from outside the package.

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

## Polymorphism
Poly is many, phism is form, right? So polymorphisms means many forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon. There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
- Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading): Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters
- Runtime polymorphism or dynamic binding (method overriding): A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is the principle of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It allows developers to focus on high-level concepts without getting bogged down by implementation specifics. In Java, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
- Abstract class: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by subclasses.
- Interface: A contract that defines a set of methods that implementing classes must provide. Interfaces can be used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.
- for example: in java we have Java Persistence API (JPA) that use abstraction to separate the data access logic from the business logic. JPA provides a set of interfaces and annotation that allow developers to interact with databases without worrying about the underlying implementation details. This abstraction enables developers to focus on defining entities and relationships while JPA handles the database interactions.
