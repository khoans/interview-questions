# What is the purpose of synchronized block in Java?
The purpose of a synchronized block in Java is to provide a mechanism for controlling access to a specific section of code by multiple threads. By using a synchronized block, you can ensure that only one thread can execute the code within the block at any given time, which helps to prevent data inconsistency and race conditions when multiple threads are accessing shared resources.
