# What is a Thread in Java?
A thread in Java is a lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by the operating system. It is a separate path of execution within a program, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently. Each thread has its own call stack, program counter, and local variables, but shares memory and resources with other threads in the same process.
