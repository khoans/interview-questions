# How is abstraction different from encapsulation?
Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, but they serve different purposes.
1. Abstraction:
- Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.
- Abstraction allows developers to create models or interfaces that represent real-world entities without delving into the complexities of their implementation.
- Example: A car can be abstracted as an object with methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate(), without needing to understand the internal mechanics of how these functions work.
2. Encapsulation:
- Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps to protect the integrity of the data.
- Encapsulation ensures that an object's internal state can only be modified through well-defined interfaces (methods), preventing unintended interference and misuse.
- Example: In a class representing a bank account, the balance attribute can be encapsulated by making it private and providing public methods like deposit() and withdraw() to modify the balance safely.
In summary, abstraction focuses on simplifying complex systems by hiding details and exposing essential features, while encapsulation focuses on protecting an object's internal state by bundling data and methods together and restricting access to them.
