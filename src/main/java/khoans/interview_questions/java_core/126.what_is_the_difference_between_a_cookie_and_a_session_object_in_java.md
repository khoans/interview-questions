# What is the difference between Cookie and Session object in Java?
A Cookie and a Session object in Java are both used to store user-specific data, but they have different characteristics and use cases. Here are the key differences between them:

1. **Storage Location**:
   - **Cookie**: A cookie is stored on the client's browser. It is sent to the server with each HTTP request.
   - **Session**: A session object is stored on the server side. The server maintains session data for each user.

2. **Lifetime**:
    - **Cookie**: Cookies can have a specified expiration time. They can persist even after the browser is closed, depending on their settings.
    - **Session**: Sessions are temporary and typically last until the user closes the browser or the session times out due to inactivity.

3. **Data Size**:

    - **Cookie**: Cookies have a size limit (usually around 4KB). They are meant for storing small amounts of data.
    - **Session**: Sessions can store larger amounts of data since they are stored on the server.

4. **Security**:

    - **Cookie**: Cookies are less secure since they are stored on the client side and can be accessed or modified by the user. Sensitive data should not be stored in cookies.
    - **Session**: Sessions are more secure as the data is stored on the server side. However, session IDs are often stored in cookies, so care must be taken to protect them.

5. **Usage**:
    - **Cookie**: Cookies are commonly used for storing user preferences, tracking user behavior, and maintaining login states.
    - **Session**: Sessions are used for storing user-specific data that needs to be maintained across multiple requests, such as shopping cart contents or user authentication information.

6. **Accessibility**:

    - **Cookie**: Cookies can be accessed by both the client (JavaScript) and the server (Java).
    - **Session**: Sessions can only be accessed by the server-side code (Java).
