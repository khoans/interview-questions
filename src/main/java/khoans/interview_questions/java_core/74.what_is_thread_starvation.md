# What is Thread Starvation?
Thread starvation is a situation in concurrent programming where a thread is perpetually denied access to necessary resources or CPU time, preventing it from making progress. This typically occurs when higher-priority threads or processes continuously consume the resources, leaving lower-priority threads unable to execute. Thread starvation can lead to performance degradation and unresponsiveness in applications, especially in real-time systems where timely execution is critical. To mitigate thread starvation, developers can implement strategies such as priority aging, where the priority of waiting threads is gradually increased over time, or by using fair scheduling algorithms that ensure all threads get a chance to execute.
