# Difference between throw and throws in Java
In Java, both `throw` and `throws` are used for exception handling, but they serve different purposes.
1. `throw`:
   - The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or a block of code.
   - It is followed by an instance of the `Throwable` class (or its subclasses).
   - It is used within the method body.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public void checkAge(int age) {
         if (age < 18) {
             throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be at least 18");
         }
     }
     ```
2. `throws`:
   - The `throws` keyword is used in a method signature to declare that a method can throw one or more exceptions.
   - It is followed by a list of exception types that the method can throw.
   - It is used in the method declaration.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public void readFile(String filePath) throws IOException {
         // code to read file
     }
     ```
In summary, `throw` is used to actually throw an exception, while `throws` is used to declare that a method may throw exceptions.
