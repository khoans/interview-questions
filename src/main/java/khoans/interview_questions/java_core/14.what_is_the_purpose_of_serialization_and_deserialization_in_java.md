# What is the purpose of serialization and deserialization in Java?
Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can then be easily stored in a file, transmitted over a network, or saved in a database. Deserialization is the reverse process, where the byte stream is converted back into a Java object.
