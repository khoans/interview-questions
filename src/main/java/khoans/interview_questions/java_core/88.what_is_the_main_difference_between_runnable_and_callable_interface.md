# What is the main difference between Runnable and Callable interface?
The main difference between the `Runnable` and `Callable` interfaces in Java lies in their ability to return a result and handle exceptions:
1. **Return Value**:
   - `Runnable`: The `Runnable` interface does not return a result. Its `run()` method has a `void` return type, meaning it cannot return any value after execution.
   - `Callable`: The `Callable` interface, on the other hand, can return a result. Its `call()` method returns a value of a specified type (generic type `V`), allowing you to retrieve the result of the computation after the task is completed.
2. **Exception Handling**:
   - `Runnable`: The `run()` method of the `Runnable` interface cannot throw checked exceptions. If an exception occurs within the `run()` method, it must be handled within the method itself.
   - `Callable`: The `call()` method of the `Callable` interface can throw checked exceptions. This allows for better error handling and propagation of exceptions to the caller.
In summary, the `Runnable` interface is used for tasks that do not require a return value and do not throw checked exceptions, while the `Callable` interface is used for tasks that need to return a result and can throw checked exceptions.
