# What are the diference between a checked and unchecked exception?
In Java, exceptions are categorized into two main types: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. The primary difference between them lies in how they are handled during the compilation and runtime of a program.
1. Checked Exceptions:
- Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. This means that the Java compiler requires the programmer to handle these exceptions explicitly, either by using a try-catch block or by declaring the exception in the method signature using the `throws` keyword.
- Examples of checked exceptions include `IOException`, `SQLException`, and `ClassNotFoundException`.
- If a method can potentially throw a checked exception, the programmer must handle it; otherwise, the code will not compile.
2. Unchecked Exceptions:
- Unchecked exceptions, also known as runtime exceptions, are not checked at compile-time. This means that the programmer is not required to handle these exceptions explicitly. They can occur during the execution of the program.
- Examples of unchecked exceptions include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and `ArithmeticException`.
- Unchecked exceptions typically indicate programming errors, such as logic errors or improper use of an API.
In summary, the key difference between checked and unchecked exceptions is that checked exceptions must be handled at compile-time, while unchecked exceptions can occur at runtime and do not require explicit handling by the programmer.
