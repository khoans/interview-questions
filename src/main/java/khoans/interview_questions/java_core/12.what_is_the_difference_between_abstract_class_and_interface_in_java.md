# What is the difference between abstract class and interface in Java?

An abstract class and an interface in Java are both used to achieve abstraction, but they have some key differences:

1. **Definition**:
    - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain both abstract methods (without
      implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
    - An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. It can only contain abstract
      methods (until Java 8, after which default and static methods were introduced).

2. Usage:
   An abstract class can have shared state or functionality. An interface is only a promise to provide the state or functionality. A good abstract class will reduce the amount of code that has to be rewritten because it's functionality or state can be shared. The interface has no defined information to be shared
