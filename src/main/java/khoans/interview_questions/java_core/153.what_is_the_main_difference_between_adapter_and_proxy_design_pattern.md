# What is the main difference between Adapter and Proxy design pattern?

The main difference between the Adapter and Proxy design patterns lies in their purpose and functionality:

1. **Adapter Design Pattern**:
    - **Purpose**: The Adapter pattern is used to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients
      expect. It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
    - **Functionality**: An adapter acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. It wraps an existing class and
      provides a new interface that is compatible with the client code.
    - **Example Use Case**: When you have a legacy system with an interface that does not match the new system's
      expected interface, you can use an adapter to make them compatible.

    ```java
    // Target interface
    interface Target {
        void request();
    }
    // Adaptee class
    class Adaptee {
        void specificRequest() {
            System.out.println("Specific request");
        }
    }
    // Adapter class
    class Adapter implements Target {
        private Adaptee adaptee;
        public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
            this.adaptee = adaptee;
        }
        @Override
        public void request() {
            adaptee.specificRequest();
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Proxy Design Pattern**:
    - **Purpose**: The Proxy pattern is used to provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access
      to it. It is often used for lazy initialization, access control, logging, or caching.
    - **Functionality**: A proxy controls access to the real object and can add additional behavior before or after
      forwarding requests to the real object.
    - **Example Use Case**: When you want to control access to a resource-intensive object, you can use a proxy to
      manage the creation and access to that object.

    ```java
    // Subject interface
    interface Subject {
        void request();
    }
    // Real subject class
    class RealSubject implements Subject {
        @Override
        public void request() {
            System.out.println("Real subject request");
        }
    }
    // Proxy class
    class Proxy implements Subject {
        private RealSubject realSubject;
        @Override
        public void request() {
            if (realSubject == null) {
                realSubject = new RealSubject();
            }
            System.out.println("Proxy controlling access");
            realSubject.request();
        }
    }
    ```
