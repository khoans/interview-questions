# What are the difference between comparable and comparator in Java?
In Java, both `Comparable` and `Comparator` are interfaces used for sorting objects, but they have some key differences:
1. **Definition**:
   - `Comparable`: This interface is implemented by the class whose objects need to be compared. It defines a natural ordering for the objects of that class.
   - `Comparator`: This interface is implemented by a separate class that defines a custom ordering for objects of a different class or the same class.
2. **Method**:
   - `Comparable`: It has a single method `compareTo(T o)` that compares the current object with the specified object.
   - `Comparator`: It has a single method `compare(T o1, T o2)` that compares two objects.
3. **Usage**:
   - `Comparable`: It is used when you want to define a default sorting order for a class. The class itself implements the `Comparable` interface.
   - `Comparator`: It is used when you want to define multiple sorting orders for a class or when you want to sort objects of a class that does not implement `Comparable`.
4. **Modification**:
   - `Comparable`: You can only have one natural ordering for a class since it is defined within the class itself.
   - `Comparator`: You can create multiple comparator classes to define different sorting orders for the same class.
5. **Location**:
   - `Comparable`: The comparison logic is located within the class being compared.
   - `Comparator`: The comparison logic is located in a separate class.
In summary, use `Comparable` when you want to define a natural ordering for a class, and use `Comparator` when you need multiple or custom sorting orders.

# What is a, b in compareTo(T o) and compare(T o1, T o2)?
In the `compareTo(T o)` method of the `Comparable` interface, `o` represents the object being compared to the current object. The method returns:
- A negative integer if the current object is less than `o`.
- Zero if the current object is equal to `o`.
- A positive integer if the current object is greater than `o`.

Example:
```java
public class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Person o) {
        return Integer.compare(this.age, o.age);
    }
}
```

In the `compare(T o1, T o2)` method of the `Comparator` interface, `o1` and `o2` are the two objects being compared. The method returns:
- A negative integer if `o1` is less than `o2`.
- Zero if `o1` is equal to `o2`.
- A positive integer if `o1` is greater than `o2`.

Example:
```java
public class PersonAgeComparator implements Comparator<Person> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Person o1, Person o2) {
        return Integer.compare(o1.getAge(), o2.getAge());
    }
}

public class PersonNameComparator implements Comparator<Person> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Person o1, Person o2) {
        return o1.getName().compareTo(o2.getName());
    }
}

public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}

// Usage
List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
people.add(new Person("Alice", 30));
people.add(new Person("Bob", 25));
Collections.sort(people, new PersonAgeComparator()); // Sort by age
Collections.sort(people, new PersonNameComparator()); // Sort by name
```
