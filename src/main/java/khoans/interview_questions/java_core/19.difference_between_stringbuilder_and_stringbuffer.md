# Difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer
In Java, both `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` are classes used to create mutable sequences of characters. However, there are some key differences between the two:
1. **Synchronization**:
   - `StringBuffer` is synchronized, which means it is thread-safe and can be used in a multi-threaded environment without additional synchronization.
   - `StringBuilder` is not synchronized, making it faster than `StringBuffer` in single-threaded scenarios but not thread-safe.
2. **Performance**:
   - Due to the synchronization overhead, `StringBuffer` is generally slower than `StringBuilder` when used in a single-threaded context.
   - `StringBuilder` is faster and more efficient for single-threaded operations.
3. **Usage**:
   - Use `StringBuffer` when you need to work with mutable strings in a multi-threaded environment.
   - Use `StringBuilder` when you are working in a single-threaded environment and need better performance.
4. **Introduced Version**:
   - `StringBuffer` has been available since JDK 1.0.
   - `StringBuilder` was introduced in JDK 1.5 as a more efficient alternative to `StringBuffer` for single-threaded scenarios.
In summary, choose `StringBuffer` for thread-safe operations and `StringBuilder` for better performance in single-threaded contexts.
