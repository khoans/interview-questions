# What is a process and thread in the context of Java?
In the context of Java, a process is an instance of a running program that has its own memory space and system resources. Each Java application runs as a separate process, and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is responsible for managing the execution of Java programs within these processes.
A thread, on the other hand, is a smaller unit of execution within a process. Threads share the same memory space and resources of the parent process, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks within the same application. In Java, threads can be created by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. Multithreading in Java enables efficient use of system resources and improves the performance of applications by allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously.
