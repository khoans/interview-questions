# Can you explain how hashmap work in Java?
A HashMap in Java is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store data in key-value pairs. It is implemented as a hash table, which allows for efficient data retrieval based on the key. Here's how a HashMap works in Java:

1. **Hashing**: When you add a key-value pair to a HashMap, the key is processed through a hash function to generate a hash code. This hash code is then used to determine the index (or bucket) in the underlying array where the key-value pair will be stored.
2. **Buckets**: The HashMap uses an array of buckets to store the key-value pairs. Each bucket can hold multiple entries in case of hash collisions (when two different keys produce the same hash code). In such cases, the entries are stored in a linked list or a balanced tree (in Java 8 and later) within that bucket.
3. **Adding Entries**: When you add a new key-value pair using the `put()` method, the HashMap calculates the hash code of the key, determines the appropriate bucket, and then adds the entry to that bucket. If the key already exists, the value is updated.
4. **Retrieving Entries**: To retrieve a value using a key, the HashMap calculates the hash code of the key, finds the corresponding bucket, and then searches through the entries in that bucket to find the matching key. If found, it returns the associated value.
5. **Handling Collisions**: When multiple keys hash to the same bucket, the HashMap handles collisions by storing the entries in a linked list or a balanced tree within that bucket. In Java 8 and later, if the number of entries in a bucket exceeds a certain threshold (TREEIFY_THRESHOLD), the linked list is converted to a balanced tree for better performance.
6. **Load Factor and Resizing**: The HashMap has a load factor (default is 0.75) that determines when to resize the underlying array. When the number of entries exceeds the product of the load factor and the current capacity, the HashMap resizes itself by creating a new array with double the capacity and rehashing all existing entries into the new array.
7. **Performance**: The average time complexity for basic operations like `put()`, `get()`, and `remove()` is O(1) due to the efficient hashing mechanism. However, in the worst case (when many collisions occur), the time complexity can degrade to O(n).
