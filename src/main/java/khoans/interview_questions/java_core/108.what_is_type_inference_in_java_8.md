# What is Type Inference in Java 8?
Type inference in Java 8 refers to the ability of the Java compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable or expression based on the context in which it is used. This feature was introduced to simplify the code and reduce redundancy, making it easier to read and maintain. With type inference, developers can often omit explicit type declarations, allowing the compiler to infer the types based on the assigned values or method return types.
One of the most notable uses of type inference in Java 8 is with the introduction of lambda expressions. When using lambda expressions, the compiler can infer the types of the parameters based on the target functional interface. For example:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Consumer;
public class TypeInferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

        // Using type inference with lambda expression
        names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
    }
}
```
