# What are the differences between Predicate, Supplier, and Consumer?
In Java, `Predicate`, `Supplier`, and `Consumer` are functional interfaces that are part of the `java.util.function` package. They are used to represent different types of functions in functional programming. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **Predicate**:
   - Represents a function that takes a single input argument and returns a boolean value.
   - It is typically used for testing or filtering data.
   - The functional method is `test(T t)`.
   - Example usage:
     ```java
     Predicate<Integer> isEven = (Integer n) -> n % 2 == 0;
     boolean result = isEven.test(4); // returns true
     ```
2. **Supplier**:
   - Represents a function that takes no input arguments and returns a value.
   - It is typically used for generating or supplying values.
   - The functional method is `get()`.
   - Example usage:
     ```java
     Supplier<Double> randomValueSupplier = () -> Math.random();
     Double randomValue = randomValueSupplier.get(); // returns a random double value
     ```
3. **Consumer**:
-  Represents a function that takes a single input argument and returns no result (void).
   - It is typically used for performing operations on an input, such as printing or modifying data.
   - The functional method is `accept(T t)`.
   - Example usage:
     ```java
     Consumer<String> printConsumer = (String s) -> System.out.println(s);
     printConsumer.accept("Hello, World!"); // prints "Hello, World!"
     ```
In summary, `Predicate` is used for testing conditions, `Supplier` is used for providing values, and `Consumer` is used for performing actions on input data.
