# What are the major differences between a HashSet and HashMap?

HashSet and HashMap are both part of the Java Collections Framework, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here are the major differences between them:
1. **Purpose**:
   - **HashSet**: It is used to store a collection of unique elements. It implements the Set interface and does not allow duplicate values.
   - **HashMap**: It is used to store key-value pairs. It implements the Map interface and allows you to associate a value with a unique key.

2. **Data Structure**:
   - **HashSet**: Internally, HashSet is backed by a HashMap. The elements in a HashSet are stored as keys in the underlying HashMap, with a constant dummy value.
   - **HashMap**: It consists of key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and each key maps to a specific value.

3. **Null Values**:
   - **HashSet**: It allows the storage of a single null element.
   - **HashMap**: It allows one null key and multiple null values.

4. **Order of Elements**:
   - **HashSet**: It does not guarantee any specific order of elements. The order may change over time as elements are added or removed.
   - **HashMap**: It also does not guarantee any specific order of key-value pairs. However, if you need a specific order, you can use LinkedHashMap or TreeMap.

5. **Performance**:
   - Both HashSet and HashMap provide constant time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains (for HashSet) or get/put (for HashMap), assuming the hash function disperses elements properly.
   - However, the performance may vary based on the load factor and the number of collisions in the hash table.

6. **Usage**:
   - **HashSet**: It is typically used when you need to maintain a collection of unique items without any specific order.
   - **HashMap**: It is used when you need to associate values with unique keys and retrieve them efficiently.
