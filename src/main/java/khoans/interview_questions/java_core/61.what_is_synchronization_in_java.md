# What is synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in Java is a mechanism that is used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads. It ensures that only one thread can access a particular resource or block of code at a time, preventing data inconsistency and race conditions. Synchronization is essential in multithreaded applications where multiple threads may attempt to read or modify shared data concurrently.

In Java, synchronization can be achieved using the `synchronized` keyword, which can be applied to methods or blocks of code. When a method or block is marked as synchronized, the thread that invokes it must acquire a lock on the object (or class, in the case of static methods) before executing the synchronized code. Other threads that attempt to access the same synchronized code will be blocked until the lock is released.
