# What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize in Java?

In Java, `final`, `finally`, and `finalize` are three distinct concepts with different purposes:

1. `final`:
    - The `final` keyword is used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance of classes.
    - When a variable is declared as `final`, its value cannot be changed once it is initialized.
    - When a method is declared as `final`, it cannot be overridden by subclasses.
    - When a class is declared
    - as `final`, it cannot be subclassed.

2. `finally`:
    - The `finally` block is used in exception handling to execute a block of code regardless of whether an exception is
      thrown or not.
    - It is typically used to release resources such as closing file streams or database connections.
    - The `finally` block always executes after the `try` and `catch` blocks, even if an exception is not caught.
    - However, if the JVM exits (e.g., via System.exit()) or if the thread is interrupted, the `finally` block may not
      execute.

3. `finalize`:

- The `finalize` method is a protected method of the `Object` class that is called by the garbage collector before an
  object is removed from memory.
    - It is used to perform cleanup operations, such as releasing resources held by the object, before it is garbage
      collected.
    - The `finalize` method can be overridden in a class to provide custom cleanup logic.
    - However, the use of `finalize` is generally discouraged in favor of other resource management techniques, such as
      try-with-resources or explicit resource release methods, because its execution is not guaranteed and can lead to
      performance issues.
