# What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Java?
Shallow copy and deep copy are two different techniques for copying objects in Java.
1. Shallow Copy:
- A shallow copy creates a new object that is a copy of the original object, but it only copies the references to the objects that are referenced by the original object. This means that if the original object contains references to other objects, the shallow copy will reference the same objects.
- Changes made to the objects referenced by the shallow copy will also affect the original object, and vice versa.
- Shallow copy can be created using the `clone()` method or by using a copy constructor.
2. Deep Copy:
- A deep copy creates a new object that is a copy of the original object, and it also creates copies of all the objects that are referenced by the original object. This means that the deep copy is completely independent of the original object.
- Changes made to the objects referenced by the deep copy will not affect the original object, and vice versa.
- Deep copy can be created by implementing the `Cloneable` interface and overriding the `clone()` method to recursively clone all referenced objects, or by using serialization and deserialization techniques.
In summary, the main difference between shallow copy and deep copy is that shallow copy copies only the references to the objects, while deep copy creates independent copies of all referenced objects.
