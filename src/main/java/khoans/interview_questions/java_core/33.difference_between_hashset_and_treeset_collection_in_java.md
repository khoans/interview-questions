# Difference between HashSet and TreeSet Collection in Java
In Java, both `HashSet` and `TreeSet` are implementations of the `Set` interface, but they have some key differences in terms of their underlying data structures, ordering, performance, and functionality.

1. **Underlying Data Structure**:
   - `HashSet`: It is backed by a hash table (actually a `HashMap` instance). It uses hashing to store elements.
   - `TreeSet`: It is backed by a Red-Black tree (a type of self-balancing binary search tree). It maintains elements in a sorted order.

2. **Ordering**:
   - `HashSet`: It does not guarantee any specific order of elements. The order may change over time as elements are added or removed.
   - `TreeSet`: It maintains elements in a sorted order according to their natural ordering (if they implement `Comparable`) or according to a specified `Comparator`.

3. **Performance**:
   - `HashSet`: It provides constant time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains, assuming the hash function disperses elements properly.
   - `TreeSet`: It provides logarithmic time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains due to the tree structure.

4. **Null Elements**:
   - `HashSet`: It allows the inclusion of a single null element.
   - `TreeSet`: It does not allow null elements. Attempting to add a null element will result in a `NullPointerException`.

5. **Use Cases**:
   - `HashSet`: It is suitable when you need a collection that provides fast access and does not require any specific order of elements.
   - `TreeSet`: It is suitable when you need a collection that maintains elements in a sorted order and allows for range-based operations.
