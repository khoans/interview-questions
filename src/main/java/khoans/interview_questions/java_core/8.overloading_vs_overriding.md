# What is overloading and overriding in Java?
Overloading and overriding are two important concepts in Java that allow developers to define methods with the same name but with different behaviors.
1. Overloading:
- methods have signatures like the order, type and number of parameters in the same class.
- Based on the which parameters are passed, the appropriate method is called.

2. Overriding:
- Methods have the same name and signature in a subclass as in its superclass.
- The method in the subclass provides a specific implementation that is different from the one in the superclass.
