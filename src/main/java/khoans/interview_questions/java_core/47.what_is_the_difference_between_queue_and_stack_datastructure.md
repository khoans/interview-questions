# What is the difference between queue and stack datastructure?
A queue and a stack are both data structures used to store and manage collections of elements, but they differ in how elements are added and removed. Here are the key differences between them:

1. **Order of Operations**:
   - **Queue**: Follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Think of it like a line of people waiting; the person who arrives first is served first.
   - **Stack**: Follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. It's similar to a stack of plates; the last plate placed on top is the first one to be taken off.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Queue**: The primary operations are `enqueue` (to add an element to the back of the queue) and `dequeue` (to remove an element from the front of the queue).
   - **Stack**: The primary operations are `push` (to add an element to the top of the stack) and `pop` (to remove an element from the top of the stack).

3. **Use Cases**:
   - **Queue**: Commonly used in scenarios such as task scheduling, breadth-first search in graphs, and handling requests in a server where order of processing matters.
   - **Stack**: Often used in scenarios such as function call management (call stack), depth-first search in graphs, and undo mechanisms in applications.

4. **Implementation**:
   - **Queue**: Can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or circular buffers.
   - **Stack**: Can also be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

In summary, the main difference between a queue and a stack lies in the order in which elements are added and removed: queues operate on a FIFO basis, while stacks operate on a LIFO basis.
