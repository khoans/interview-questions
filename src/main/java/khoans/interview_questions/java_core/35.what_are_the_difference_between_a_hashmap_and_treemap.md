# What are the difference between a HashMap and TreeMap?
A HashMap and TreeMap are both implementations of the Map interface in Java, but they have some key differences:
1. **Ordering**:
   - HashMap does not guarantee any specific order of the elements. The order may change over time as elements are added or removed.
   - TreeMap maintains a sorted order of the elements based on their natural ordering (if they implement Comparable) or based on a provided Comparator.

2. **Performance**:
   - HashMap provides constant-time performance (O(1)) for basic operations like get and put, assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly.
   - TreeMap provides logarithmic-time performance (O(log n)) for basic operations like get and put, due to its underlying Red-Black tree structure.

3. **Null Keys and Values**:
   - HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
   - TreeMap does not allow null keys (throws NullPointerException) but allows multiple null values

4. **Implementation**:
   - HashMap is implemented as a hash table.
   - TreeMap is implemented as a Red-Black tree.

5. **Use Cases**:
   - Use HashMap when you need fast access to elements and do not care about the order.
   - Use TreeMap when you need to maintain a sorted order of elements or need to perform range-based operations.
