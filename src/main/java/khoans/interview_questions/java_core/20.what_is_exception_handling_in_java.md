# What is exception handling in Java?
Exception handling in Java is a mechanism that allows developers to handle runtime errors and exceptional conditions in a controlled manner. It enables the program to continue its execution or terminate gracefully instead of crashing abruptly. Exception handling is implemented using a combination of keywords: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`.
