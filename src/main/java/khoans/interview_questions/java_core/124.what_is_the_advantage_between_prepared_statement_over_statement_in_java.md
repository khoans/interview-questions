# What is the advantage between PreparedStatement over Statement in Java?
In Java, both `PreparedStatement` and `Statement` are used to execute SQL queries against a database. However, `PreparedStatement` offers several advantages over `Statement`, making it a preferred choice in many scenarios. Here are some of the key advantages of using `PreparedStatement`:

1. **Precompilation and Performance**:
   - `PreparedStatement` is precompiled by the database, which means that the SQL query is parsed and optimized only once. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when executing the same query multiple times with different parameters.
   - In contrast, `Statement` is compiled each time it is executed, which can be less efficient for repeated queries.

2. **Parameterization**:
   - `PreparedStatement` allows you to use placeholders (question marks) in the SQL query, which can be replaced with actual values at runtime. This makes it easier to create dynamic queries and reduces the risk of SQL injection attacks.
   - With `Statement`, you have to concatenate strings to build the SQL query, which can lead to errors and vulnerabilities.

3. **SQL Injection Prevention**:
   - `PreparedStatement` automatically escapes special characters in the input values, making it much harder for attackers to inject malicious SQL code. This is a crucial security feature that helps protect your application from SQL injection attacks.
   - `Statement` does not provide this protection, making it more susceptible to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

4. **Type Safety**:
   - When using `PreparedStatement`, you can set parameters using specific setter methods (e.g., `setInt()`, `setString()`, etc.), which ensures that the data types are correctly handled. This reduces the chances of type-related errors.
   - With `Statement`, you have to manually convert data types to strings, which can lead to errors if not done correctly.

5. **Readability and Maintainability**:
   - `PreparedStatement` can make your code more readable and maintainable by separating the SQL logic from the data values. This separation can make it easier to understand and modify the code.
   - Using `Statement` can lead to complex and hard-to-read code due to string concatenation.

Overall, `PreparedStatement` is generally the preferred choice for executing SQL queries in Java due to its performance benefits, security features, and ease of use.


```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class PreparedStatementExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
        String user = "username";
        String password = "password";
        String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?";
        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
             PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {

            // Set the parameter value
            preparedStatement.setInt(1, 25);

            // Execute the query
            ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();

            // Process the results
            while (resultSet.next()) {
                System.out.println("User ID: " + resultSet.getInt("id"));
                System.out.println("User Name: " + resultSet.getString("name"));
                System.out.println("User Age: " + resultSet.getInt("age"));
            }

        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

# What is a ResultSet in Java?
In Java, a `ResultSet` is an object that represents the result of a database query executed using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It is part of the `java.sql` package and is used to retrieve and manipulate the data returned by executing SQL statements, such as `SELECT` queries. The `ResultSet` object provides methods to navigate through the rows of the result set and to access the data in each row. Here are some key features and functionalities of the `ResultSet`:
1. **Navigation**: The `ResultSet` allows you to navigate through the rows of the result set using methods like `next()`, `previous()`, `first()`, `last()`, and `absolute(int row)`. The most commonly used method is `next()`, which moves the cursor to the next row in the result set.
2. **Data Retrieval**: You can retrieve data from the current row of the `ResultSet` using various getter methods, such as `getInt()`, `getString()`, `getDouble()`, etc. These methods allow you to access the values of specific columns by either their index or their column name.
3. **Type Safety**: The `ResultSet` provides type-safe methods for retrieving data, ensuring that you get the correct data type for each column.
4. **Metadata**: The `ResultSet` can provide metadata about the result set, such as the number of columns, column names, and data types, through the `ResultSetMetaData` object.
5. **Concurrency and Updatability**: Depending on how the `ResultSet` is created, it can be either read-only or updatable. Updatable `ResultSet` objects allow you to modify the data in the database directly through the `ResultSet`.
Here is a simple example of how to use a `ResultSet` in Java:
```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class ResultSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
        String user = "username";
        String password = "password";
        String query = "SELECT * FROM users";
        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
             Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
             ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query)) {
            // Process the results
            while (resultSet.next()) {
                System.out.println("User ID: " + resultSet.getInt("id"));
                System.out.println("User Name: " + resultSet.getString("name"));
                System.out.println("User Age: " + resultSet.getInt("age"));
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, we connect to a MySQL database, execute a `SELECT` query to retrieve all users, and use the `ResultSet` to iterate through the results and print the user details.
