# What is a priority queue in Java?
A priority queue in Java is a specialized type of queue that orders its elements based on their priority rather than their insertion order. Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are typically served in the order they were added to the queue (though this behavior can vary based on the implementation).
In Java, the `PriorityQueue` class is part of the `java.util` package and implements the `Queue` interface. It uses a binary heap data structure to efficiently manage the ordering of elements based on their priority.
Here are some key features of the `PriorityQueue` in Java:
1. **Ordering**: By default, the `PriorityQueue` orders its elements according to their natural ordering (i.e., the order defined by the `Comparable` interface). However, you can also provide a custom `Comparator` to define a different ordering.
2. **Dynamic Size**: The size of a `PriorityQueue` can grow and shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.
3. **No Null Elements**: The `PriorityQueue` does not allow null elements.
4. **Not Thread-Safe**: The `PriorityQueue` is not synchronized, so it is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a `PriorityQueue` concurrently, external synchronization is required.
5. **Common Operations**:
   - `offer(E e)`: Adds an element to the queue.
   - `poll()`: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue (the element with the highest priority).
   - `peek()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue.
   - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
Here is a simple example of using a `PriorityQueue` in Java:
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Comparator;
public class PriorityQueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a priority queue with a custom comparator for descending order
        PriorityQueue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.reverseOrder());

        // Add elements to the priority queue
        priorityQueue.offer(5);
        priorityQueue.offer(1);
        priorityQueue.offer(3);

        // Poll elements from the priority queue
        while (!priorityQueue.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(priorityQueue.poll());
        }
    }
}
```
