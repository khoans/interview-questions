# What is the contract of hashCode and equals in Java?
In Java, the `hashCode` and `equals` methods have a specific contract that must be followed to ensure the correct behavior of objects when they are used in hash-based collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `Hashtable`. The contract is as follows:
1. **Consistency between equals and hashCode**:
   - If two objects are considered equal according to the `equals` method, they must have the same hash code as returned by the `hashCode` method.
   - Conversely, if two objects have different hash codes, they must not be considered equal by the `equals` method.
2. **Reflexivity**:
   - For any non-null reference value `x`, `x.equals(x)` must return `true`.
3. **Symmetry**:
   - For any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, `x.equals(y)` must return `true` if and only if `y.equals(x)` returns `true`.
4. **Transitivity**:
   - For any non-null reference values `x`, `y`, and `z`, if `x.equals(y)` returns `true` and `y.equals(z)` returns `true`, then `x.equals(z)` must also return `true`.
5. **Consistency**:
   - For any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, multiple invocations of `x.equals(y)` must consistently return `true` or consistently return `false`, provided no information used in `equals` comparisons on the objects is modified.
6. **Non-nullity**:
   - For any non-null reference value `x`, `x.equals(null)` must return `false`.
7. **hashCode consistency**:
   - The `hashCode` method must consistently return the same integer value for the same object, provided no information used in `equals` comparisons on the object is modified. This integer value can vary between different executions of the application.
By adhering to this contract, you ensure that objects behave correctly when used in hash-based collections, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of objects.
