# How can a synchronized block cause thread starvation in Java?
Thread starvation in Java occurs when a thread is perpetually denied access to resources it needs to proceed with its execution. A synchronized block can contribute to thread starvation in the following ways:
1. **Lock Contention**: When multiple threads attempt to access a synchronized block, they must acquire the lock associated with the object. If one thread holds the lock for an extended period, other threads may be forced to wait indefinitely, leading to starvation.
2. **Priority Inversion**: If a high-priority thread is waiting for a lock held by a low-priority thread, the high-priority thread may be starved of CPU time, as the low-priority thread may not get scheduled to run and release the lock.
3. **Unfair Locking**: The default locking mechanism in Java is not fair, meaning that there is no guarantee that threads will acquire locks in the order they requested them. This can lead to situations where some threads are consistently favored over others, causing starvation for the less favored threads.
4. **Long-Running Operations**: If a synchronized block contains long-running operations, it can hold the lock for an extended period, preventing other threads from accessing the synchronized block and leading to starvation.
To mitigate thread starvation, developers can consider using fair locks (e.g., `ReentrantLock` with fairness set to true), reducing the scope of synchronized blocks, and avoiding long-running operations within synchronized blocks.
