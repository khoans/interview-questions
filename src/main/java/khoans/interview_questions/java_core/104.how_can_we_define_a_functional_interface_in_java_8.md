# How can we define a Functional Interface in Java 8?
A Functional Interface in Java 8 is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. This allows the interface to be used as the target for lambda expressions and method references, enabling functional programming features in Java.
To define a Functional Interface in Java 8, you can follow these steps:
1. **Create an Interface**: Define a new interface using the `interface` keyword.
2. **Single Abstract Method**: Ensure that the interface contains only one abstract method. This method can have any name and any number of parameters, but there should be only one.
3. **Use the @FunctionalInterface Annotation (Optional)**: Although not mandatory, it is a good practice to annotate the interface with `@FunctionalInterface`. This annotation helps to indicate that the interface is intended to be a functional interface and provides compile-time checking to ensure that the interface meets the criteria.
Here is an example of how to define a Functional Interface in Java 8:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    // Single abstract method
    void performAction(String input);
} 
```
In this example, `MyFunctionalInterface` is a functional interface with a single abstract method `performAction`. You can now use this interface as a target for lambda expressions or method references, like so:
```java
public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using a lambda expression to implement the functional interface
        MyFunctionalInterface action = (input) -> System.out.println("Action performed with input: " + input);
        
        // Calling the method
        action.performAction("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a lambda expression that implements the `performAction` method of the `MyFunctionalInterface` and then call the method with a sample input.
