# What are the rules for creating immutable objects?
Creating immutable objects in Java involves following certain rules to ensure that the object's state cannot be modified after its creation. Here are the key rules for creating immutable objects:
1. **Declare the class as final**: This prevents other classes from extending it and potentially modifying its behavior.
   ```java
   public final class ImmutableClass {
   ```
2. **Make all fields private and final**: This ensures that the fields cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class.
   ```java
   private final int field1;
   private final String field2;
   ```
3. **Initialize all fields through the constructor**: Provide a constructor that sets the values of all fields when the object is created.
   ```java
   public ImmutableClass(int field1, String field2) {
       this.field1 = field1;
       this.field2 = field2;
   }
   ```
4. **Do not provide setter methods**: Avoid providing any methods that allow modification of the fields after the object is created.
5. **Provide getter methods for accessing field values**: If you need to expose the field values, provide public getter methods that return the values without allowing modification.
   ```java
   public int getField1() {
       return field1;
   }

   public String getField2() {
       return field2;
   }
   ```
6. **Handle mutable fields carefully**: If the class contains fields that are mutable objects (e.g., arrays, collections), ensure that you do not expose references to these objects. Instead, return copies of the mutable objects in the getter methods.
   ```java
   public List<String> getMutableList() {
       return new ArrayList<>(mutableList);
   }
   ```
7. **Avoid methods that modify the object's state**: Ensure that no methods in the class modify the state of the object.
By following these rules, you can create immutable objects in Java that are thread-safe and maintain a consistent state throughout their lifecycle.
