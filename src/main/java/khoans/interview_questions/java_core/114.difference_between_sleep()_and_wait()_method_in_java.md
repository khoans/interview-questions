# Difference Between sleep() and wait() Method in Java
In Java, both `sleep()` and `wait()` are methods used to pause the execution of a thread, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between the two methods:

1. **Class Location**:
   - `sleep()`: It is a static method of the `Thread` class.
   - `wait()`: It is a method of the `Object` class.

2. **Purpose**:
   - `sleep()`: It is used to pause the execution of the current thread for a specified period of time (in milliseconds or nanoseconds).
   - `wait()`: It is used to make the current thread wait until another thread invokes `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on the same object.

3. **Lock Release**:
   - `sleep()`: It does not release any locks held by the thread. The thread remains in the runnable state after the sleep duration is over.
   - `wait()`: It releases the lock held by the thread on the object it is called on, allowing other threads to acquire the lock.
