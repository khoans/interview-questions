# Thread Lifecycle in Java
[]: # In Java, a thread goes through several states during its lifecycle. Understanding these states is crucial for effective multithreading and concurrency management. The main states of a thread in Java are:

[]: # 1. **New (Created)**: When a thread is created using the `Thread` class or by implementing the `Runnable` interface, it is in the "New" state. At this point, the thread has not yet started executing.

[]: # 2. **Runnable**: When the `start()` method is called on a thread, it transitions to the "Runnable" state. In this state, the thread is ready to run and is waiting for CPU time to execute its `run()` method. The thread scheduler determines when the thread will actually run.

[]: # 3. **Running**: When the thread scheduler selects a thread from the Runnable state, it moves to the "Running" state. In this state, the thread is actively executing its `run()` method.

[]: # 4. **Blocked/Waiting**: A thread can enter the "Blocked" or "Waiting" state when it is waiting for a resource or another thread to complete its task. This can happen in several scenarios, such as:
[]: #    - Waiting for I/O operations to complete.
[]: #    - Waiting to acquire a lock on an object (synchronized block/method).
[]: #    - Calling methods like `wait()`, `join()`, or `sleep()`.

[]: # 5. **Timed Waiting**: A thread enters the "Timed Waiting" state when it is waiting for a specified amount of time. This can occur when methods like `sleep(milliseconds)`, `wait(milliseconds)`, or `join(milliseconds)` are called.

[]: # 6. **Terminated (Dead)**: A thread enters the "Terminated" state when it has completed its execution or has been explicitly stopped. Once a thread reaches this state, it cannot be restarted.

[]: # Understanding these states helps developers manage thread behavior effectively, ensuring proper synchronization and resource management in multithreaded applications.
