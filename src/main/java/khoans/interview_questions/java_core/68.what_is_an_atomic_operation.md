# What is an atomic operation?
An atomic operation is a low-level programming operation that is performed as a single, indivisible step. This means that once an atomic operation begins, it cannot be interrupted or observed in an incomplete state by other threads or processes. Atomic operations are crucial in concurrent programming, as they help ensure data integrity and prevent race conditions when multiple threads access shared resources.
