# What is an interface in Java?
An interface in Java is a reference type that defines a contract for classes to implement. It is a collection of abstract methods (methods without a body) and constant variables (static final fields). Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. A class that implements an interface must provide concrete implementations for all the abstract methods defined in the interface. Interfaces allow for loose coupling between classes, as they define a common set of behaviors that can be shared across different classes, regardless of their position in the class hierarchy. This promotes code reusability and flexibility in designing software systems.
