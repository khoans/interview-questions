# Explain the concept of hash collision in Java.
Hash collision in Java occurs when two different keys produce the same hash code when passed through a hash function. In Java, hash codes are used in data structures like HashMap and HashSet to efficiently store and retrieve objects. When a hash collision happens, both keys are mapped to the same index in the underlying array of the hash table. To handle hash collisions, Java uses techniques such as chaining and open addressing. In chaining, each index in the hash table contains a linked list of entries that share the same hash code. When a collision occurs, the new entry is added to the linked list at that index. In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot in the array to store the new entry. Proper handling of hash collisions is crucial for maintaining the performance and efficiency of hash-based data structures in Java.
