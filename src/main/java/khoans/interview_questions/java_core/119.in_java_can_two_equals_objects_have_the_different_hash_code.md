# In Java can two equals objects have the different hash code?
Yes, in Java, it is possible for two objects that are considered equal (i.e., `obj1.equals(obj2)` returns `true`) to have different hash codes. However, this situation violates the general contract of the `hashCode()` method, which states that if two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, they must have the same hash code.
