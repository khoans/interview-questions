# What is a race condition?
A race condition is a situation in concurrent programming where the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events, such as the order in which threads are scheduled to execute. This can lead to unpredictable and erroneous outcomes when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously without proper synchronization. Race conditions can result in data corruption, inconsistent results, and hard-to-debug issues.
