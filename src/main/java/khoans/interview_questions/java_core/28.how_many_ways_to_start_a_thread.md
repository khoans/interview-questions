# How many ways to start a thread in Java?
In Java, there are primarily two ways to start a thread:
1. **Extending the Thread class**:
   You can create a new class that extends the `Thread` class and override its `run()` method. To start the thread, you create an instance of your subclass and call the `start()` method.

   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyThread thread = new MyThread();
           thread.start(); // Start the thread
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Implementing the Runnable interface**:

    You can create a class that implements the `Runnable` interface and provide an implementation for the `run()` method. To start the thread, you create an instance of `Thread`, passing your `Runnable` implementation to its constructor, and then call the `start()` method.
    
    ```java
    class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
         public void run() {
              System.out.println("Thread is running");
         }
    }
    
    public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
              MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
              Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
              thread.start(); // Start the thread
         }
    }
    ```
   
3. Use Callable and FutureTask (Java 5 and later):
   You can implement the `Callable` interface, which allows you to return a result from the thread. You then wrap the `Callable` in a `FutureTask` and pass it to a `Thread`. Or you can use an `ExecutorService` to manage threads more efficiently.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

class MyCallable implements Callable<String> {
    public String call() {
        return "Thread is running";
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        MyCallable myCallable = new MyCallable();
        Future<String> future = executor.submit(myCallable);
        
        try {
            String result = future.get(); // Get the result from the thread
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown(); // Shutdown the executor
        }
    }
}
```
These are the primary ways to start a thread in Java. Each method has its own use cases and advantages depending on the requirements of your application.
