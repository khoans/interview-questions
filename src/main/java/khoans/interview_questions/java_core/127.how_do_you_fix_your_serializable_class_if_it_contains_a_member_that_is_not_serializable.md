# How do fix your Serializable class if it contains a member that is not Serializable?
If your Serializable class contains a member that is not Serializable, you can fix this issue by marking that member as transient. The transient keyword in Java indicates that a field should not be serialized when the object is serialized. This means that the value of the transient field will not be saved during serialization, and it will be initialized to its default value (null for objects, 0 for numeric types, false for boolean) when the object is deserialized.
