# Difference between hard comparison (==) and equals() method in Java

In Java, both the `==` operator and the `equals()` method are used to compare objects, but they do so in different ways:

1. `==` Operator:
    - The `==` operator compares the references (memory addresses) of two objects to check if they point to the same
      memory location.
    - It checks for reference equality, meaning it returns true only if both references point to the exact same object
      in memory.
    - Example:
      ```java
      String str1 = new String("hello");
      String str2 = new String("hello");
      System.out.println(str1 == str2); // false, because they are different objects in memory
      ```
2. `equals()` Method:
    - The `equals()` method is used to compare the actual content or state of two objects.
    - It checks for value equality, meaning it returns true if the objects have the same value, even if they are
      different objects in memory.
    - The `equals()` method can be overridden in custom classes to define what it means for two instances to be
      considered equal.
    - Example:
      ```java
      String str1 = new String("hello");
      String str2 = new String("hello");
      System.out.println(str1.equals(str2)); // true, because their content is the same
         ```
