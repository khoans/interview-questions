# What is the concept of exception propagation in Java?
Exception propagation in Java refers to the process by which an exception is passed up the call stack from the method where it occurred to the method that called it, and so on, until it is either caught and handled or reaches the top of the call stack, resulting in program termination. This mechanism allows for centralized error handling and helps maintain the flow of the program by allowing higher-level methods to decide how to handle exceptions that occur in lower-level methods.
