# Which two methods should be always implemented by HashMap key objects?
In Java, when using objects as keys in a `HashMap`, it is essential to properly implement two methods from the `Object` class:
1. `hashCode()`: This method returns an integer hash code value for the object. The hash code is used by the `HashMap` to determine the bucket location where the key-value pair will be stored. It is crucial that if two objects are considered equal (i.e., their `equals()` method returns `true`), they must have the same hash code. Failing to do so can lead to incorrect behavior when retrieving values from the `HashMap`.

2. `equals(Object obj)`: This method checks whether the current object is equal to another object. When retrieving a value from a `HashMap`, the `equals()` method is used to compare the key being searched for with the keys stored in the map. If two keys are considered equal, they should return `true` when compared using the `equals()` method.
