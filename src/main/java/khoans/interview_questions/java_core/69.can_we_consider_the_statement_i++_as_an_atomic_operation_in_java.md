# Can we consider the statement i++ as an atomic operation in Java?
No, the statement `i++` cannot be considered an atomic operation in Java. The `i++` operation is actually a combination of three separate steps:
1. Read the current value of `i`.
2. Increment the value by 1.
3. Write the new value back to `i`.

Since these steps can be interleaved with operations from other threads, `i++` is not atomic. This means that if multiple threads are incrementing the same variable `i` concurrently, it can lead to race conditions and inconsistent results. To ensure atomicity when incrementing a variable in a multithreaded environment, you can use classes from the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package, such as `AtomicInteger`, which provides atomic operations for integer values.8z
