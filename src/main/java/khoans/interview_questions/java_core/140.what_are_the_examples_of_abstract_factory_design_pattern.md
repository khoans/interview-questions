# What are the examples of abstract factory design pattern?
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Here are some examples of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern:

1. **GUI Toolkit**:
   - An abstract factory can be used to create different types of GUI components (buttons, text fields, checkboxes) for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). Each operating system would have its own concrete factory that implements the abstract factory interface to create the appropriate components.

   ```java
   // Abstract Factory
   interface GUIFactory {
       Button createButton();
       TextField createTextField();
   }

   // Concrete Factory for Windows
   class WindowsFactory implements GUIFactory {
       public Button createButton() {
           return new WindowsButton();
       }
       public TextField createTextField() {
           return new WindowsTextField();
       }
   }

   // Concrete Factory for macOS
   class MacOSFactory implements GUIFactory {
       public Button createButton() {
           return new MacOSButton();
       }
       public TextField createTextField() {
           return new MacOSTextField();
       }
   }
   ```
