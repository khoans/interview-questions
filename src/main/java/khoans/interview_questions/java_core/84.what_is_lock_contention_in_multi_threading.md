# What is Lock Contention in Multi-Threading?
Lock contention in multi-threading refers to a situation where multiple threads compete for the same lock or resource, leading to delays and reduced performance. When a thread tries to acquire a lock that is already held by another thread, it must wait until the lock is released. This waiting can cause threads to be blocked, leading to increased latency and decreased throughput in a multi-threaded application.
