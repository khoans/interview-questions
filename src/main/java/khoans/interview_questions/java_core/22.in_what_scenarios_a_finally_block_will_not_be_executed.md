# In what scenarios a finally block will not be executed?
In Java, a `finally` block is designed to execute after a `try` block, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. However, there are certain scenarios where a `finally` block may not be executed:
1. **System.exit() Call**: If the `System.exit()` method is called within the `try` or `catch` block, the JVM will terminate, and the `finally` block will not be executed.
2. **Infinite Loop or Blocking Call**: If the code within the `try` or `catch` block enters an infinite loop or a blocking call (e.g., waiting for I/O), the `finally` block may never be reached.
3. **Thread Termination**: If the thread executing the `try` block is abruptly terminated (e.g., using `Thread.stop()`), the `finally` block may not execute.
4. **Power Failure or Crash**: If the JVM crashes or the system experiences a power failure while executing the `try` or `catch` block, the `finally` block will not be executed.
5. **Fatal Errors**: If a fatal error occurs (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`), the JVM may not be able to execute the `finally` block.
In general, while the `finally` block is intended to always execute, these exceptional scenarios can prevent its execution
