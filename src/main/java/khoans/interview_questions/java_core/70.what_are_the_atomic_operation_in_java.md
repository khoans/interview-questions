# What are atomic operation in Java?
Atomic operations in Java are operations that are performed as a single, indivisible step, ensuring that they are completed without interruption. This means that once an atomic operation starts, it cannot be interrupted or observed in an incomplete state by other threads. Atomic operations are essential in concurrent programming to maintain data integrity and prevent race conditions when multiple threads access shared resources.

In Java, atomic operations can be achieved using classes from the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package, which provides a set of atomic classes such as `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicBoolean`, and `AtomicReference`. These classes offer methods that perform atomic operations on their respective data types.
Some common atomic operations provided by these classes include:
1. **get()**: Retrieves the current value atomically.
2. **set()**: Sets a new value atomically.
3. **compareAndSet(expectedValue, newValue)**: Atomically sets the value to `newValue` if the current value is equal to `expectedValue`.
4. **getAndIncrement()**: Atomically increments the current value by 1 and returns the previous value.
5. **getAndDecrement()**: Atomically decrements the current value by 1 and returns the previous value.
6. **getAndAdd(delta)**: Atomically adds the specified `delta` to the current value and returns the previous value.
