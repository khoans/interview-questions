# What are the scenarios to use parallel stream in Java 8?
The parallel stream in Java 8 is a powerful feature that allows for parallel processing of data collections. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to leverage multi-core processors to improve performance. Here are some scenarios where using parallel streams is beneficial:
1. **Large Data Sets**: When working with large collections of data, such as lists or arrays, parallel streams can significantly speed up processing by dividing the workload across multiple threads.
2. **CPU-Bound Operations**: If the operations being performed on the data are CPU-intensive (e.g., complex calculations, data transformations), parallel streams can help utilize multiple CPU cores effectively.
3. **Independent Operations**: When the operations performed on each element of the stream are independent of each other, parallel streams can be used without the risk of data inconsistency or race conditions.
4. **Stateless Operations**: Parallel streams work best with stateless operations, where the result of processing one element does not depend on the state of another element.
5. **Data Processing Pipelines**: When you have a series of operations (e.g., filtering, mapping, reducing) that can be executed in parallel, using parallel streams can help optimize the entire data processing pipeline.
6. **Performance Improvement**: If you have identified performance bottlenecks in your application related to data processing, switching to parallel streams can help alleviate these issues by distributing the workload.

Example of using parallel stream to process a large list of numbers:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
public class ParallelStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
        // Using parallel stream to compute the sum of squares
        int sumOfSquares = numbers.parallelStream()
                                  .mapToInt(n -> n * n)
                                  .sum();
        System.out.println("Sum of squares: " + sumOfSquares);
    }
}
```
In this example, we use a parallel stream to compute the sum of squares of a list of numbers, which allows for concurrent processing and improved performance.
