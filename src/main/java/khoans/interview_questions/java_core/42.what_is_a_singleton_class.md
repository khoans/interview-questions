# What is a singleton class in Java?
A singleton class in Java is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. A singleton class typically has the following characteristics:
1. **Private Constructor**: The constructor of the singleton class is made private to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class.
2. **Static Instance**: A static variable holds the single instance of the class.
3. **Public Static Method**: A public static method (often named `getInstance()`) is provided to allow access to the single instance. This method checks if the instance already exists; if not, it creates the instance and returns it.
