# Linked List vs ArrayList in Java
In Java, both LinkedList and ArrayList are implementations of the List interface, but they have different underlying data structures and performance characteristics.
1. Data Structure:
- ArrayList is backed by a dynamic array, which means it stores elements in contiguous memory locations. When the array reaches its capacity, it creates a new larger array and copies the elements over.
- LinkedList is implemented as a doubly linked list, where each element (node) contains a reference to the previous and next node. This allows for efficient insertions and deletions.
2. Performance:
- ArrayList provides fast random access to elements using an index, with a time complexity of O(1). However, adding or removing elements from the middle of the list can be slow, with a time complexity of O(n) due to the need to shift elements.
- LinkedList allows for efficient insertions and deletions, especially at the beginning or end of the list, with a time complexity of O(1). However, accessing elements by index is slower, with a time complexity of O(n), as it requires traversing the list from the beginning or end.
3. Memory Usage:
- ArrayList generally uses less memory than LinkedList because it stores elements in a contiguous block of memory. However, it may allocate more memory than needed to accommodate future growth.
- LinkedList uses more memory due to the overhead of storing references for each node (previous and next).
4. Use Cases:
- ArrayList is preferred when you need fast random access to elements and when the number of elements is relatively stable.
- LinkedList is preferred when you need frequent insertions and deletions, especially at the beginning or end of the list, and when random access is not a primary concern.
