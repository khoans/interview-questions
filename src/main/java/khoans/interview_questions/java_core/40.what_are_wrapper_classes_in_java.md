# What are wrapper classes in Java?
Wrapper classes in Java are special classes that provide a way to use primitive data types (such as int, char, double, etc.) as objects. Each primitive data type has a corresponding wrapper class in the `java.lang` package:
- `int` -> `Integer`
- `char` -> `Character`
- `double` -> `Double`
- `float` -> `Float`
- `boolean` -> `Boolean`
- `byte` -> `Byte`
- `short` -> `Short`
- `long` -> `Long`

Wrapper classes are useful in several scenarios:
1. **Object Manipulation**: Since Java is an object-oriented language, wrapper classes allow primitive types to be treated as objects, enabling them to be used in collections like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc., which can only store objects.
2. **Utility Methods**: Wrapper classes provide various utility methods for converting between types, parsing strings, and performing operations on the primitive values.
3. **Nullability**: Wrapper classes can be null, whereas primitive types cannot. This is useful in scenarios where you need to represent the absence of a value.
4. **Autoboxing and Unboxing**: Java provides a feature called autoboxing (automatic conversion of primitive types to their corresponding wrapper classes) and unboxing (conversion of wrapper classes back to primitive types), which simplifies the code and improves readability.
