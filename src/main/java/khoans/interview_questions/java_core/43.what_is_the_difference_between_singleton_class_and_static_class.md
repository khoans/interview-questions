# What is the difference between singleton class and static class?
In Java, a singleton class and a static class are two different design patterns used to manage the instantiation and behavior of classes. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **Instantiation**:
   - **Singleton Class**: A singleton class allows only one instance of the class to be created. It provides a global point of access to that instance. The instance is typically created lazily (when it is first requested).
   - **Static Class**: A static class cannot be instantiated at all. It is a class that contains only static members (methods and variables) and is used as a utility class.

2. **State Management**:
   - **Singleton Class**: A singleton class can maintain state through instance variables. Since there is only one instance, the state is shared across the application.
   - **Static Class**: A static class does not maintain state through instance variables since it cannot be instantiated. Any state must be managed through static variables.
