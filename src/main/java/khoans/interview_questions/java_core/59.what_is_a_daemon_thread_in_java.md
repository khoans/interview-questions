# What is a daemon thread in Java?
A daemon thread in Java is a special type of thread that runs in the background and is designed to provide services to user threads. Daemon threads are typically used for tasks such as garbage collection, background monitoring, and other housekeeping tasks that do not require user intervention.
Daemon threads have the following characteristics:

1. **Background Execution**: Daemon threads run in the background and do not prevent the JVM from exiting when all user threads have finished executing. When the last user thread terminates, the JVM will automatically terminate all daemon threads.
2. **Low Priority**: Daemon threads usually have lower priority compared to user threads, meaning they may not get as much CPU time as user threads.
3. **Creation**: You can create a daemon thread by calling the `setDaemon(true)` method on a `Thread` object before starting the thread. Once a thread is started, its daemon status cannot be changed.
4. **Use Cases**: Common use cases for daemon threads include background tasks like garbage collection, logging, and monitoring system resources.
