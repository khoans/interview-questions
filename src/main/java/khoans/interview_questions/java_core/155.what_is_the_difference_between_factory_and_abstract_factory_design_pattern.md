# What is the difference between factory and abstract factory design pattern?
The Factory Method and Abstract Factory are both creational design patterns, but they have some key differences in their purpose and implementation:

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Factory Method**: The Factory Method pattern is used to create objects of a single type or family of related types. It defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - **Abstract Factory**: The Abstract Factory pattern is used to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It provides an interface for creating multiple types of related objects.

2. **Structure**:
   - **Factory Method**: In the Factory Method pattern, a single factory method is defined in a base class, and subclasses override this method to create specific types of objects.
   - **Abstract Factory**: In the Abstract Factory pattern, an abstract factory interface defines multiple factory methods for creating different types of related objects. Concrete factories implement this interface to create specific families of objects.

3. **Complexity**:
   - **Factory Method**: The Factory Method pattern is generally simpler and focuses on a single product creation.
   - **Abstract Factory**: The Abstract Factory pattern is more complex and is used when there is a need to create multiple related products.

4. **Example**:
   - **Factory Method**: A logging framework that creates different types of loggers (e.g., ConsoleLogger, FileLogger) based on configuration.
```java
    // Logger interface
interface Logger {
    void log(String message);
}

// Concrete Logger implementations
class ConsoleLogger implements Logger {
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Console Logger: " + message);
    }
}

class FileLogger implements Logger {
    public void log(String message) {
        // Code to log to a file
        System.out.println("File Logger: " + message);
    }
}

// Logger Factory
abstract class LoggerFactory {
    public abstract Logger createLogger();
}

class ConsoleLoggerFactory extends LoggerFactory {
    public Logger createLogger() {
        return new ConsoleLogger();
    }
}

class FileLoggerFactory extends LoggerFactory {
    public Logger createLogger() {
        return new FileLogger();
    }
}

```
  - **Abstract Factory**: A GUI toolkit that creates different types of UI components (buttons, text fields) for different operating systems (Windows, macOS).
```java
    // Abstract Factory
    interface GUIFactory {
        Button createButton();
        TextField createTextField();
    }
    // Concrete Factory for Windows
    class WindowsFactory implements GUIFactory {
        public Button createButton() {
            return new WindowsButton();
        }
        public TextField createTextField() {
            return new WindowsTextField();
        }
    }
    // Concrete Factory for macOS
    class MacOSFactory implements GUIFactory {
        public Button createButton() {
            return new MacOSButton();
        }
        public TextField createTextField() {
            return new MacOSTextField();
        }
    }
    
```
  ```
In summary, the Factory Method pattern is used for creating a single type of object, while the Abstract Factory pattern is used for creating families of related objects.
