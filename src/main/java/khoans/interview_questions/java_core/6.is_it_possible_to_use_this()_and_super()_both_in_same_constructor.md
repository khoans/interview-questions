# Is it possible to use this() and super() both in same constructor?
In Java, it is not possible to use both `this()` and `super()` in the same constructor. This is because both `this()` and `super()` must be the first statement in a constructor. When you call `this()`, it invokes another constructor in the same class, while `super()` invokes a constructor in the superclass. Since only one of these can be the first statement, you cannot use both in the same constructor.
