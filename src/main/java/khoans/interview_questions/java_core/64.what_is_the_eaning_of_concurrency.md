# What is the meaning of concurrency?
Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously or in overlapping time periods. In the context of computer science and programming, concurrency allows multiple threads or processes to run independently, potentially improving the efficiency and responsiveness of applications. Concurrency can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as multithreading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming. It is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks can be performed in parallel, such as handling multiple user requests, performing background computations, or managing I/O operations. Concurrency helps optimize resource utilization and can lead to better performance in applications that require high throughput or responsiveness.
