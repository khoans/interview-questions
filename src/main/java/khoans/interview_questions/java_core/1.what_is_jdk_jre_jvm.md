# What is JDK, JRE, JVM?
JDK (Java Development Kit), JRE (Java Runtime Environment), and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) are three essential components of the Java programming language ecosystem.
1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
- JVM is an abstract computing machine that enables Java bytecode to be executed on any platform without modification. It is responsible for interpreting the compiled Java code (bytecode) and converting it into machine code that can be executed by the host operating system.
- JVM provides platform independence, meaning that Java applications can run on any device or operating system that has a compatible JVM implementation.
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
- JRE is a software package that provides the necessary libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components required to run Java applications.
- It includes the JVM, core libraries, and other resources needed for executing Java programs but does not include development tools like compilers and debuggers.
- JRE is intended for end-users who want to run Java applications on their devices.
3. JDK (Java Development Kit):
- JDK is a complete software development kit that includes everything needed to develop, compile, and run Java applications.
- It contains the JRE, JVM, development tools (such as the Java compiler, debugger, and other utilities), and additional libraries for building Java applications.
- JDK is intended for developers who want to create Java applications.
In summary, JVM is the engine that runs Java bytecode, JRE provides the environment to run Java applications, and JDK is the full toolkit for developing Java applications.
