# What are some of the JDBC components?
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API that enables Java applications to interact with relational databases. It provides a set of classes and interfaces for connecting to databases, executing SQL queries, and processing results. Some of the key JDBC components include:
1. **DriverManager**:
   - The `DriverManager` class is responsible for managing a list of database drivers. It establishes a connection to the database by selecting an appropriate driver based on the database URL provided.

2. **Connection**:
   - The `Connection` interface represents a connection to a specific database. It provides methods for creating statements, managing transactions, and closing the connection.

3. **Statement**:
   - The `Statement` interface is used to execute SQL queries against the database. There are three types of statements:
     - `Statement`: Used for executing static SQL queries.
     - `PreparedStatement`: Used for executing precompiled SQL queries with parameters.
     - `CallableStatement`: Used for executing stored procedures in the database.

4. **ResultSet**:
   - The `ResultSet` interface represents the result set of a SQL query. It provides methods for navigating through the rows of data and retrieving column values.

5. **SQLException**:
   - The `SQLException` class is used to handle database access errors and other SQL-related exceptions. It provides information about the error, including the SQL state, error code, and a descriptive message.
