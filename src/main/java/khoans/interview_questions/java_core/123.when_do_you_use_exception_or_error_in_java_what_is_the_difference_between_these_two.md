# When do you use exception or error in java ? What is the difference between these two?
In Java, both exceptions and errors are subclasses of the `Throwable` class, but they represent different types of issues that can occur during the execution of a program. Here are the key differences and when to use each:

1. **Exceptions**:
   - Exceptions are conditions that a program might want to catch and handle. They represent issues that can occur during the normal operation of a program, such as invalid input, file not found, or network issues.
   - Exceptions can be categorized into two types:
     - **Checked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that must be either caught or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword. Examples include `IOException`, `SQLException`, etc.
     - **Unchecked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that do not need to be declared or caught. They are subclasses of `RuntimeException`, such as `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, etc.
   - Use exceptions when you want to handle recoverable conditions in your code.

2. **Errors**:
   - Errors are conditions that are typically outside the control of the program and indicate serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. They usually represent issues with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) itself, such as memory leaks or stack overflows.
   - Examples of errors include `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`, etc.
   - Use errors when dealing with unrecoverable conditions that should not be caught or handled by the application.
