# What are the examples of Decorator Design Pattern?
The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. Here are some common examples of the Decorator Design Pattern in Java:

1. **Java I/O Streams**: The Java I/O library extensively uses the Decorator Pattern. For example, `BufferedInputStream`, `DataInputStream`, and `PushbackInputStream` are decorators that add functionality to the basic `InputStream` class. You can wrap an `InputStream` with these decorators to add buffering, data reading capabilities, or pushback functionality.

```java
InputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
InputStream bufferedInputStream = new BufferedInputStream(fileInputStream);
```

2. **Java Swing Components**: In Java Swing, components like `JScrollPane` and `JPanel` can be used as decorators to add additional functionality to existing components. For example, you can wrap a `JTextArea` with a `JScrollPane` to add scrolling capabilities.

```java
JTextArea textArea = new JTextArea();
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(textArea);
```

3. **Logging Frameworks**: Many logging frameworks use the Decorator Pattern to add different logging behaviors. For example, you can have a base logger and then decorate it with additional functionality like file logging, console logging, or formatting.

```java
Logger baseLogger = new ConsoleLogger();
Logger fileLogger = new FileLogger(baseLogger);
fileLogger.log("This is a log message.");
```

4. **Coffee Shop Example**: A classic example of the Decorator Pattern is a coffee shop where you can add different toppings to a basic coffee. Each topping (like milk, sugar, whipped cream) can be implemented as a decorator that adds its own cost and description to the base coffee.

```java
Beverage coffee = new Espresso();
coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);

coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);
System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.cost());
```

These examples illustrate how the Decorator Design Pattern can be used to enhance the functionality of objects dynamically without altering their core structure.
