# Difference between String and StringBuilder in Java
In Java, both `String` and `StringBuilder` are used to handle sequences of characters, but they have some key differences:
1. **Mutability**:
   - `String`: Immutable. Once a `String` object is created, its value cannot be changed. Any modification to a `String` results in the creation of a new `String` object.
   - `StringBuilder`: Mutable. You can modify the contents of a `StringBuilder` object without creating a new object. This makes it more efficient for scenarios where frequent modifications are needed.
2. **Performance**:
   - `String`: Due to its immutability, operations that modify a `String` (like concatenation) can be less efficient, as they create new objects and involve additional memory allocation.
   - `StringBuilder`: Generally faster for concatenation and modifications because it modifies the existing object in place, reducing the overhead of creating new objects.

# What is a String pool in Java?
In Java, the String pool (also known as the String constant pool) is a special memory area in the Java heap that stores String literals. When a String literal is created, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) checks the String pool to see if an identical String already exists. If it does, the reference to the existing String is returned instead of creating a new String object. This mechanism helps to save memory and improve performance by reusing immutable String objects.
