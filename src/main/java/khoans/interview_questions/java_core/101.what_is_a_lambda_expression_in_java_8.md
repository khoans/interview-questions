# What is a Lambda Expression in Java 8?
A lambda expression in Java 8 is a concise way to represent a functional interface (an interface with a single abstract method) using an expression. It allows you to write instances of functional interfaces in a more compact and readable manner compared to traditional anonymous classes. Lambda expressions are introduced in Java 8 to support functional programming concepts and enable the use of higher-order functions.
