# What is the observer design pattern?
The observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (the observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where a change in one object needs to be reflected in multiple other objects without tightly coupling them together.
