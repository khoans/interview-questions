# What are the examples of Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern?
The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows multiple objects to handle a request without the sender needing to know which object will ultimately handle it. The request is passed along a chain of handlers until one of them processes it. Here are some common examples of the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern:

1. **Logging Frameworks**:
   - In logging frameworks, different loggers (handlers) can be set up to handle log messages of varying severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR). A log message is passed through the chain of loggers until it reaches the appropriate logger that can handle it.

2. **Customer Support Systems**:
- In customer support systems, a support request can be passed through different levels of support staff (handlers) based on the complexity of the issue. For example, a basic inquiry might be handled by a front-line support agent, while more complex issues are escalated to specialized technicians.


3. **Middleware in Web Applications**:
   - In web applications, middleware components can be arranged in a chain to process incoming HTTP requests. Each middleware component can choose to handle the request or pass it along to the next component in the chain.

4. **Event Handling Systems**:
   - In event handling systems, events can be passed through a chain of event handlers. Each handler can decide whether to process the event or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

5. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - In authentication and authorization systems, a request for access can be passed through a chain of authentication and authorization handlers. Each handler can verify different aspects of the request (e.g., credentials, permissions) before granting or denying access.

6. **Document Processing Systems**:
   - In document processing systems, a document can be passed through a chain of processing steps (handlers) such as validation, formatting, and approval. Each step can choose to process the document or pass it to the next step in the chain.

Here is a simple example of the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in Java:

```java
// Handler interface
public abstract class Handler {
    protected Handler nextHandler;
    public void setNextHandler(Handler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }
    public abstract void handleRequest(String request);
}

// Concrete handler classes
public class ConcreteHandlerA extends Handler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equals("A")) {
            System.out.println("ConcreteHandlerA handled the request: " + request);
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

public class ConcreteHandlerB extends Handler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equals("B")) {
            System.out.println("ConcreteHandlerB handled the request: " + request);
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Handler handlerA = new ConcreteHandlerA();
        Handler handlerB = new ConcreteHandlerB();
        handlerA.setNextHandler(handlerB);
        handlerA.handleRequest("B"); // Output: ConcreteHandlerB handled the request: B
    }
}
```
