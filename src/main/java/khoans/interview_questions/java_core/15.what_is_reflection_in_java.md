# What is reflection in Java?
Reflection in Java is a powerful feature that allows a program to inspect and manipulate its own structure and behavior at runtime. It enables developers to access information about classes, methods, fields, and annotations, even if they are private or protected. With reflection, you can dynamically create instances of classes, invoke methods, and modify fields without knowing their names at compile time.
