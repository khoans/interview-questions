# What is the purpose of join() in Thread class?
The `join()` method in the Thread class is used to pause the execution of the current thread until the thread on which `join()` was called has completed its execution. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that a particular thread has finished its task before the main thread or another thread continues its execution.

When you call `thread.join()`, the current thread will wait for the specified thread (`thread`) to die (i.e., complete its run method). If the specified thread has already finished, the current thread continues without waiting.
