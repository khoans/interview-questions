# Why java does not support mulitple inheritance?
Java does not support multiple inheritance (the ability for a class to inherit from more than one class) primarily to avoid complexity and ambiguity that can arise from it. Here are some key reasons:
1. **Diamond Problem**: One of the most well-known issues with multiple inheritance is the "diamond problem." This occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common superclass. If both parent classes override a method from the superclass, it creates ambiguity about which method should be inherited by the subclass. Java avoids this problem by not allowing multiple inheritance of classes.

To achieve similar functionality, Java uses interfaces, which can be implemented by a class. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for a form of multiple inheritance without the associated complexities.
