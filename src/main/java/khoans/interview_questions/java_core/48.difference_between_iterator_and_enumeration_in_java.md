# Difference between Iterator and Enumeration in Java
Iterator and Enumeration are both interfaces in Java that are used to traverse collections of objects, but they have some key differences:
1. **Introduction**:
   - **Enumeration**: It is a legacy interface that was introduced in JDK 1.0.
   - **Iterator**: It was introduced in JDK 1.2 as part of the Java Collections Framework.

2. **Methods**:
   - **Enumeration**: It has two main methods:
     - `hasMoreElements()`: Checks if there are more elements to iterate over.
     - `nextElement()`: Returns the next element in the iteration.
   - **Iterator**: It has three main methods:
     - `hasNext()`: Checks if there are more elements to iterate over.
     - `next()`: Returns the next element in the iteration.
     - `remove()`: Removes the last element returned by the iterator from the underlying collection.

3. **Modification of Collection**:
   - **Enumeration**: It does not provide a way to modify the collection during iteration.
   - **Iterator**: It allows modification of the collection during iteration using the `remove()` method.

4. **Type Safety**:
   - **Enumeration**: It is not type-safe, as it returns elements of type `Object`. You may need to cast the returned elements to the desired type.
   - **Iterator**: It is type-safe when used with generics, allowing you to specify the type of elements in the collection.

5. **Usage**:
   - **Enumeration**: It is primarily used with legacy classes like `Vector` and `Hashtable`.
   - **Iterator**: It is used with all modern collection classes in the Java Collections Framework, such as `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap`.

In summary, while both Iterator and Enumeration are used for traversing collections, Iterator is more versatile and preferred in modern Java programming due to its ability to modify collections and its type safety with generics.
