# List out all the JOIN types in SQL and provide a brief explanation for each.

In SQL, there are several types of JOINs that allow you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Here are the main JOIN types:
1. **INNER JOIN**: 
   - Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. If there is no match, the row is not included in the result set.

2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**:
   - Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**:
   - Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**:
   - Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table that does not have a match.

5. **CROSS JOIN**:
   - Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning it combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table. This type of join does not require a condition to join the tables.
   - Example: If Table A has 3 rows and Table B has 4 rows, the result will have 12 rows (3 x 4).

6. **SELF JOIN**:
   - A self join is a regular join but the table is joined with itself. It is useful for querying hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table.
   - Example: Finding employees who are also managers in the same employee table.

These JOIN types allow for flexible data retrieval and manipulation based on the relationships between tables in a database.
