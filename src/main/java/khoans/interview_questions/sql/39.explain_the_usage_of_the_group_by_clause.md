# Explain the usage of the GROUP BY clause.
The `GROUP BY` clause in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups. It is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions (such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) to perform calculations on each group of data. Here are some key points about the usage of the `GROUP BY` clause:
1. **Grouping Data**: The primary purpose of the `GROUP BY` clause is to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. For example, you can group sales data by product category to get total sales for each category.
2. **Aggregate Functions**: When using `GROUP BY`, you typically apply aggregate functions to the grouped data. For example, you can use `SUM` to calculate the total sales for each group.
3. **Syntax**: The basic syntax of the `GROUP BY` clause is as follows:
   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3)
   FROM table_name
   WHERE condition
   GROUP BY column1, column2;
   ```
4. **HAVING Clause**: The `HAVING` clause is often used with `GROUP BY` to filter groups based on a specified condition. It is similar to the `WHERE` clause but is applied after the grouping.
5. **Multiple Columns**: You can group by multiple columns by specifying them in the `GROUP BY` clause, which allows for more granular grouping of data.
6. **Order of Execution**: The `GROUP BY` clause is executed after the `WHERE` clause but before the `ORDER BY` clause in the SQL query execution order.
7. **Example**:
   ```sql
   SELECT department, COUNT(employee_id) AS employee_count
   FROM employees
   GROUP BY department;
   ```
   This query groups employees by their department and counts the number of employees in each department.
In summary, the `GROUP BY` clause is a powerful tool in SQL for summarizing and aggregating data based on specific criteria.
