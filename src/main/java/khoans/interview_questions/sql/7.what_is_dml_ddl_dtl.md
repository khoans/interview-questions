# What is DML, DDL, DTL?
DML, DDL, and DTL are categories of SQL (Structured Query Language) commands used to interact with and manage databases. Each category serves a different purpose in database management.

1. DML (Data Manipulation Language):
DML commands are used to manipulate and manage data within database tables. Common DML commands include:
- `SELECT`: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
- `INSERT`: Adds new records to a table.
- `UPDATE`: Modifies existing records in a table.
- `DELETE`: Removes records from a table.
- `MERGE`: Combines data from two tables based on a specified condition.
- `CALL`: Executes a stored procedure.


2. DDL (Data Definition Language):
DDL commands are used to define and manage the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, and schemas. Common DDL commands include:
- `CREATE`: Creates new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.
- `ALTER`: Modifies the structure of existing database objects.
- `DROP`: Deletes database objects.
- `TRUNCATE`: Removes all records from a table while keeping its structure intact.
- `RENAME`: Changes the name of a database object.
- `COMMENT`: Adds comments to database objects for documentation purposes.

3. DTL (Data Transaction Language):
DTL commands are used to manage transactions in a database. Transactions are sequences of operations that are treated as a single unit of work. Common DTL commands include:
- `COMMIT`: Saves all changes made during the current transaction to the database.
- `ROLLBACK`: Undoes all changes made during the current transaction.
- `SAVEPOINT`: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
- `SET TRANSACTION`: Configures transaction properties, such as isolation levels
