# Difference between view and materialized view in SQL
A view and a materialized view are both database objects that represent a stored query, but they have some key differences in terms of how they store and manage data.
1. **Definition**:
   - **View**: A view is a virtual table that is defined by a SQL query. It does not store data physically; instead, it retrieves data from the underlying tables whenever it is queried.
   - **Materialized View**: A materialized view, on the other hand, is a physical copy of the result set of a query. It stores the data on disk and can be refreshed periodically to reflect changes in the underlying tables.
2. **Data Storage**:
   - **View**: Since a view does not store data, it does not consume storage space. The data is fetched from the base tables each time the view is accessed.
   - **Materialized View**: A materialized view consumes storage space because it stores the result set of the query on disk.
3. **Performance**:
   - **View**: Querying a view can be slower than querying a materialized view, especially for complex queries, because the data is retrieved from the base tables each time.
   - **Materialized View**: Querying a materialized view is generally faster because the data is precomputed and stored on disk.
4. **Data Freshness**:
   - **View**: A view always reflects the most current data from the underlying tables since it retrieves data in real-time.
   - **Materialized View**: A materialized view may not always reflect the most current data, as it needs to be refreshed to update its contents. The refresh can be done manually or automatically at specified intervals.
5. **Use Cases**:
   - **View**: Views are typically used for simplifying complex queries, providing a level of abstraction, and enhancing security by restricting access to specific columns or rows.
   - **Materialized View**: Materialized views are used for improving query performance, especially for complex aggregations and joins, where the data does not change frequently.
In summary, the main difference between a view and a materialized view lies in data storage, performance, and data freshness. Views are virtual and do not store data, while materialized views store a physical copy of the data for faster access.
