# Difference Between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL
The `UNION` and `UNION ALL` operators in SQL are used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` statements. However, they have some key differences:
1. **Duplicates**:
   - `UNION`: This operator removes duplicate rows from the combined result set. If there are identical rows in the results of the `SELECT` statements, only one instance of each duplicate row will be included in the final result.
   - `UNION ALL`: This operator includes all rows from the combined result set, including duplicates. If there are identical rows in the results of the `SELECT` statements, all instances of those duplicate rows will be included in the final result.
2. **Performance**:
   - `UNION`: Since `UNION` removes duplicates, it requires additional processing to compare the rows and eliminate duplicates. This can lead to slower performance, especially with large datasets.
   - `UNION ALL`: This operator is generally faster than `UNION` because it does not perform any duplicate elimination. It simply combines the results of the `SELECT` statements as they are.
3. **Use Cases**:
   - `UNION`: Use `UNION` when you want to ensure that the result set contains only unique rows.
   - `UNION ALL`: Use `UNION ALL` when you want to include all rows, including duplicates, and when performance is a concern.
