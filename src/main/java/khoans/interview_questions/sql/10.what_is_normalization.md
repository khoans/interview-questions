# What is normalization?
Normalization is a database design technique used to organize data in a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependencys. The main goal of normalization is to ensure that each piece of data is stored in only one place, which helps to improve data integrity and reduce the chances of data anomalies. Normalization is typically achieved through a series of normal forms, each with specific rules and requirements. The most commonly used normal forms are:
1. First Normal Form (1NF): Ensures that each column contains atomic values and that there are no repeating groups or arrays in a table.
2. Second Normal Form (2NF): Builds on 1NF by ensuring that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. This means that there should be no partial dependencies.
3. Third Normal Form (3NF): Builds on 2NF by ensuring that there are no transitive dependencies. This means that non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes.
4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): A stricter version of 3NF that addresses certain types of anomalies not covered by 3NF.
Normalization helps to create a well-structured database that is easier to maintain, update, and query. However, it is important to strike a balance between normalization and performance, as highly normalized databases may require more complex queries and joins, which can impact performance. In some cases, denormalization (the process of intentionally introducing redundancy) may be used to improve performance for specific use cases.
