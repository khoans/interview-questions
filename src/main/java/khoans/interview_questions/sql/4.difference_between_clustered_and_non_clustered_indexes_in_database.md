# Difference between Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes in Database
In a database, indexes are used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations. There are two main types of indexes: clustered and non-clustered indexes. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **Structure**:
   - **Clustered Index**: A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. The rows are stored in the order of the clustered index key. There can be only one clustered index per table because the data rows can be sorted in only one order.
   - **Non-Clustered Index**: A non-clustered index, on the other hand, does not affect the physical order of the data. Instead, it creates a separate structure that contains a copy of the indexed columns along with a pointer to the actual data rows. A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - **Clustered Index**: The data rows are stored directly in the leaf nodes of the clustered index.
   - **Non-Clustered Index**: The leaf nodes of a non-clustered index contain pointers to the actual data rows, which are stored separately.
