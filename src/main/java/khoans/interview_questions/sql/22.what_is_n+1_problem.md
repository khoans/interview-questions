# What is N+1 Problem?
The N+1 problem is a common performance issue that occurs in database access patterns, particularly in object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks. It arises when an application needs to load a collection of related entities from the database, resulting in an excessive number of queries being executed.
For example, consider a scenario where you have two tables: `Authors` and `Books`, where each author can have multiple books. If you want to retrieve a list of authors along with their books, an N+1 problem can occur if the application first queries for all authors (1 query) and then, for each author, executes an additional query to fetch their books (N queries). This results in a total of N+1 queries, which can lead to significant performance degradation, especially when N is large.

To mitigate the N+1 problem, developers can use techniques such as eager loading, where related entities are fetched in a single query using joins, or batch fetching, where multiple related entities are retrieved in fewer queries. These approaches help reduce the number of database round-trips and improve overall application performance.

Or you can use Fetch Joins in your queries to load related entities in a single query, thus avoiding the N+1 problem altogether.

Or you can use DataLoader pattern to batch and cache database requests, minimizing the number of queries executed and preventing the N+1 problem.

In summary, the N+1 problem is a performance issue that arises from executing multiple database queries to load related entities, and it can be addressed through various optimization techniques to improve data retrieval efficiency.
