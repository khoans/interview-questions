# What is a Stored Procedure?
A Stored Procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that are stored in the database. It is designed to perform a specific task or a set of related tasks, such as querying, inserting, updating, or deleting data. Stored Procedures can accept input parameters, return output parameters, and can also return result sets. They are used to encapsulate business logic, improve performance by reducing the need for repeated SQL parsing and execution planning, and enhance security by controlling access to underlying data. Stored Procedures can be executed using the `EXECUTE` or `CALL` statement, depending on the database management system (DBMS) being used. They are commonly used in various DBMSs, including SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
