# What is referential ingregrity in relational database?
Referential integrity is a fundamental concept in relational database management systems (RDBMS) that ensures the consistency and accuracy of data between related tables. It is a set of rules that govern the relationships between tables, specifically focusing on the foreign key constraints. A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table.
