# What is Database Statistic? How it affects the performance of your query?
Database statistics are metadata that provide information about the distribution and characteristics of data within a database. These statistics are used by the database management system (DBMS) to optimize query performance by helping the query optimizer make informed decisions about the most efficient way to execute a query. Database statistics typically include information such as:
- **Table Statistics**: Information about the number of rows, pages, and data distribution within a table.
- **Index Statistics**: Details about the number of distinct values, density, and distribution of values in indexed columns.
- **Column Statistics**: Information about the distribution of values in specific columns, including histograms that show the frequency of different values.
- **Data Distribution**: Information about how data is distributed across different partitions or segments of a table.
Database statistics affect query performance in several ways:
1. **Query Optimization**: The query optimizer uses statistics to estimate the cost of different execution plans for a query. Accurate statistics help the optimizer choose the most efficient plan, which can significantly reduce query execution time.
2. **Index Selection**: Statistics help the optimizer determine whether to use an index for a query. If the statistics indicate that an index will provide a significant performance benefit, the optimizer may choose to use it.
3. **Join Strategies**: When executing queries that involve joins, statistics help the optimizer decide on the best join strategy (e.g., nested loop join, hash join, merge join) based on the estimated number of rows involved in the join.
4. **Resource Allocation**: Accurate statistics allow the DBMS to allocate resources more effectively, such as memory and CPU, for query execution.
5. **Avoiding Suboptimal Plans**: Outdated or inaccurate statistics can lead to suboptimal execution plans, resulting in longer query execution times and increased resource consumption.
To maintain optimal query performance, it is important to regularly update database statistics, especially after significant data modifications (inserts, updates, deletes) or changes to the database schema. Most DBMSs provide tools and commands to gather and update statistics automatically or manually.
