# What is a temp table?
A temporary table, often referred to as a "temp table," is a special type of database table that is created and used for a short period of time during a database session. Temp tables are typically used to store intermediate results, perform complex calculations, or hold data that is only needed temporarily during the execution of a query or a series of queries. Temp tables can be created in various ways, depending on the database management system (DBMS) being used. In SQL Server, for example, temp tables can be created using the `CREATE TABLE` statement with a `#` prefix for local temp tables (e.g., `#TempTable`) or `##` prefix for global temp tables (e.g., `##GlobalTempTable`). In other DBMSs like MySQL or PostgreSQL, temp tables can be created using the `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` statement. Temp tables are typically stored in a special area of the database, such as the tempdb in SQL Server, and they are automatically dropped when the database session ends or when the connection is closed. This means that temp tables do not persist beyond the scope of the session in which they were created. Temp tables can be very useful for improving query performance, simplifying complex queries, and managing data in a more organized way during data processing tasks. However, it's important to use them judiciously, as excessive use of temp tables can lead to increased resource consumption and potential performance issues.
