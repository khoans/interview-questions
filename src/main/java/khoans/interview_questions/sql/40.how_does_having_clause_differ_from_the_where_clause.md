# How does HAVING clause differ from the WHERE clause?
The HAVING clause and the WHERE clause are both used to filter data in SQL queries, but they serve different purposes and are applied at different stages of the query execution process:
1. **WHERE Clause**:
   - The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before any grouping or aggregation takes place. It is applied to individual rows in the table.
   - It is used to specify conditions that must be met for rows to be included in the result set.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
     FROM employees
     WHERE salary > 50000
     GROUP BY department;
     ```
   - In this example, the WHERE clause filters out employees with a salary of 50,000 or less before the grouping occurs.

2. **HAVING Clause**:
   - The HAVING clause is used to filter groups after the aggregation has taken place. It is applied to the results of the GROUP BY clause.
   - It is used to specify conditions that must be met for groups to be included in the result set.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
     FROM employees
     GROUP BY department
     HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
     ```
   - In this example, the HAVING clause filters out departments that have 10 or fewer employees after the grouping has occurred.
In summary, use the WHERE clause to filter individual rows before grouping, and use the HAVING clause to filter groups after aggregation.
