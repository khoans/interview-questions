# When a table is said to be in 1NF, 2NF, 3NF?
Normalization is a database design technique that organizes tables to minimize redundancy and dependency. The different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) represent levels of normalization:
1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**:
   - A table is in 1NF if it meets the following criteria:
     - All columns contain atomic (indivisible) values.
     - Each column contains values of a single type.
     - Each column has a unique name.
     - The order in which data is stored does not matter.
   - Essentially, 1NF eliminates repeating groups and ensures that each cell contains only one value.
This table violates 1NF because the "Phone Numbers" column contains multiple values (123-456-7890, 987-654-3210) in a single cell.
| CustomerID | Name       | Phone Numbers          |
|------------|------------|------------------------|
| 1          | John Doe   | 123-456-7890, 987-654-3210 |
To convert this table to 1NF, we can create a separate row for each phone number:
| CustomerID | Name       | Phone Number   |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| 1          | John Doe   | 123-456-7890  |
| 1          | John Doe   | 987-654-3210  |
2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**:
   - A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
   - This means that there should be no partial dependency of any column on the primary key. If a table has a composite primary key, all non-key attributes must depend on the entire key, not just part of it.
This table violates 2NF because the "Course Name" depends only on "CourseID" and not on the full primary key (StudentID, CourseID).
| StudentID | CourseID | Course Name   |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 1         | 101      | Math          |
| 1         | 102      | Science       |
| 2         | 101      | Math          |
To convert this table to 2NF, we can create a separate table for courses:
**StudentsCourses Table**:
| StudentID | CourseID |
|-----------|----------|
| 1         | 101      |
| 1         | 102      |
| 2         | 101      |
**Courses Table**:
| CourseID | Course Name   |
|----------|----------------|
| 101      | Math          |
| 102      | Science       |
3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:
   - A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and all the non-key attributes are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
   - This means that non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes.
This table violates 3NF because "Department Name" depends on "DepartmentID," which is not the primary key.
| EmployeeID | Employee Name | DepartmentID | Department Name |
|------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1          | Alice          | 10           | HR              |
| 2          | Bob            | 20           | IT              |
To convert this table to 3NF, we can create a separate table for departments:
**Employees Table**:
| EmployeeID | Employee Name | DepartmentID |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1          | Alice          | 10           |
| 2          | Bob            | 20           |
**Departments Table**:
| DepartmentID | Department Name |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 10           | HR              |
| 20           | IT              |
By following these normalization rules, we can design efficient and well-structured database tables that reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
