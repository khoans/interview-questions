# Different Types of Isolation Levels in SQL
In SQL, isolation levels define the degree to which the operations in one transaction are isolated from those in other concurrent transactions. Different isolation levels provide varying degrees of consistency and concurrency control. The main types of isolation levels in SQL are:
1. **Read Uncommitted**:
   - This is the lowest isolation level. Transactions can read data that has been modified by other transactions but not yet committed. This can lead to "dirty reads," where a transaction reads uncommitted changes that may later be rolled back.

2. **Read Committed**:
   - In this isolation level, a transaction can only read data that has been committed by other transactions. This prevents dirty reads but allows "non-repeatable reads," where a transaction reads the same data multiple times and gets different results if another transaction modifies the data in between.

3. **Repeatable Read**:
   - This isolation level ensures that if a transaction reads a row, it will see the same value if it reads that row again during the same transaction. This prevents non-repeatable reads but can still allow "phantom reads," where new rows are added by other transactions that match the search criteria of a query.

4. **Serializable**:
   - This is the highest isolation level. Transactions are completely isolated from each other, as if they were executed serially, one after the other. This prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. However, it can lead to reduced concurrency and potential performance issues due to increased locking.
