# How does index work?
An index in a database is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It works by creating a separate structure that allows the database to quickly locate and access the data without having to scan the entire table. Here's how an index typically works:
1. **Data Structure**: An index is usually implemented using data structures like B-trees or hash tables. These structures allow for efficient searching, sorting, and range queries.
2. **Index Creation**: When an index is created on one or more columns of a table, the database builds the index by organizing the values of those columns in a way that allows for fast lookups. The index contains the indexed column values along with pointers (or references) to the corresponding rows in the table.
3. **Searching**: When a query is executed that involves a search condition on the indexed columns, the database engine uses the index to quickly locate the relevant rows. Instead of scanning the entire table, the engine traverses the index structure to find the matching values, which significantly reduces the number of rows that need to be examined.
4. **Efficiency**: The efficiency of an index comes from its ability to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed. For example, in a B-tree index, the search operation can be performed in logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)), compared to linear time complexity (O(n)) for a full table scan.
