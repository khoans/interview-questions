# Difference between Primary Key and Unique Key Constraint in SQL
In SQL, both Primary Key and Unique Key constraints are used to enforce uniqueness on a column or a set of columns in a table. However, there are some key differences between the two:
1. **Uniqueness**:
   - **Primary Key**: A Primary Key constraint ensures that the values in the specified column(s) are unique and not null. It uniquely identifies each record in a table.
   - **Unique Key**: A Unique Key constraint also ensures that the values in the specified column(s) are unique, but it allows for null values. Multiple nulls are allowed in a Unique Key column.
2. **Number of Constraints**:
   - **Primary Key**: A table can have only one Primary Key constraint, which can consist of one or more columns (composite key).
   - **Unique Key**: A table can have multiple Unique Key constraints, each on different columns or sets of columns.
3. **Index Creation**:
   - **Primary Key**: When a Primary Key constraint is created, a unique index is automatically created on the column(s) defined as the Primary Key.
   - **Unique Key**: When a Unique Key constraint is created, a unique index is also automatically created on the column(s) defined as the Unique Key.
4. **Nullability**:
   - **Primary Key**: Columns defined as Primary Key cannot contain null values.
   - **Unique Key**: Columns defined as Unique Key can contain null values, and multiple nulls are allowed.
5. **Purpose**:
   - **Primary Key**: The primary purpose of a Primary Key is to uniquely identify each record in a table.
   - **Unique Key**: The primary purpose of a Unique Key is to ensure that the values in a column or set of columns are unique, but it does not serve as the main identifier for records in the table.
In summary, while both Primary Key and Unique Key constraints enforce uniqueness, the Primary Key is more restrictive in terms of nullability and the number of constraints allowed per table.
