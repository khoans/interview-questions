# What is ACID? Explain.
ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. Let's break down each of these properties:
1. **Atomicity**: This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. This means that either all the operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged.
2. **Consistency**: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state. This means that any data written to the database must adhere to all predefined rules, such as constraints, cascades, and triggers. If a transaction violates any of these rules, it will be rolled back to maintain the integrity of the database.
3. **Isolation**: Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction should operate as if it is the only transaction in the system. This means that the intermediate states of a transaction are not visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed. Different isolation levels can be set to control the degree of visibility between concurrent transactions.
4. **Durability**: Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures, such as crashes or power outages. This is typically achieved through the use of transaction logs and backups, which ensure that committed data can be recovered in the event of a failure.
In summary, ACID properties are essential for ensuring the reliability and integrity of database transactions, providing a robust framework for managing data in multi-user environments.
