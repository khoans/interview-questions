# Difference between truncate, delete and drop in SQL
In SQL, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE`, and `DROP` are commands used to remove data from a database, but they operate in different ways and have different implications:
1. **DELETE**:
   - The `DELETE` command is used to remove specific rows from a table based on a condition specified in the `WHERE` clause. If no condition is provided, all rows in the table will be deleted.
   - It is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command.
   - `DELETE` operations can be rolled back if they are part of a transaction.
   - It generates individual row delete operations, which can be slower for large datasets.
   - Example: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
2. **TRUNCATE**:
   - The `TRUNCATE` command is used to remove all rows from a table, effectively resetting the table to its empty state.
   - It is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command.
   - `TRUNCATE` operations cannot be rolled back in most database systems.
   - It is generally faster than `DELETE` for large tables because it does not generate individual row delete operations; instead, it deallocates the data pages used by the table.
   - Example: `TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;`
3. **DROP**:
   - The `DROP` command is used to completely remove a table (or other database objects like views, indexes, etc.) from the database.
   - It is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command.
   - `DROP` operations cannot be rolled back.
   - When a table is dropped, all its data, structure, and associated objects (like indexes, constraints) are permanently deleted.
   - Example: `DROP TABLE table_name;`
In summary, use `DELETE` to remove specific rows, `TRUNCATE` to quickly remove all rows from a table, and `DROP` to completely remove the table itself from the database.
