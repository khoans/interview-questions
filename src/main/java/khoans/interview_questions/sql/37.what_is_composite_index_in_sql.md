# What is composite index in SQL?
A composite index in SQL is an index that is created on multiple columns of a table. It allows for faster retrieval of data when queries involve conditions on more than one column. By combining multiple columns into a single index, the database can efficiently search and filter records based on the values of those columns. Composite indexes are particularly useful when queries frequently use a combination of columns in the WHERE clause, JOIN conditions, or ORDER BY clauses. They help improve query performance by reducing the number of rows that need to be scanned, leading to faster data access and retrieval times.
