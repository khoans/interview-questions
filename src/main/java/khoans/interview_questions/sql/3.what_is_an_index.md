# What is an Index in SQL?
An index in SQL is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It is similar to an index in a book, which allows you to quickly locate specific information without having to read through the entire book. In a database, an index is created on one or more columns of a table, and it provides a way to quickly look up rows based on the values in those columns. By creating an index, the database can avoid scanning the entire table for a query, which can significantly improve performance, especially for large tables. However, indexes also come with some overhead, as they require additional storage space and can slow down data modification operations (such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index needs to be updated as well. 

Under the hood, an index is typically implemented using data structures like B-trees or hash tables, which allow for efficient searching and sorting of data. Overall, indexes are a crucial tool for optimizing database performance and ensuring efficient data access. Allowing for logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for search operations instead of linear time complexity (O(n)).
