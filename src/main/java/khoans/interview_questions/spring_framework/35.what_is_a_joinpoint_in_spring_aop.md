# What is a JoinPoint in Spring AOP?
In Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), a JoinPoint represents a specific point in the execution of a program where an aspect can be applied. It is a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception. JoinPoints are the points in the program flow where advice (additional behavior) can be inserted by aspects.
