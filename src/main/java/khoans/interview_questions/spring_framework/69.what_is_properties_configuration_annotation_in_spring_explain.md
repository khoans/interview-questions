# What is @PropertyConfiguration annotation in Spring? Explain.
The `@PropertyConfiguration` annotation in Spring is used to indicate that a class is a source of property configurations. It is typically used in conjunction with the `@Configuration` annotation to define a configuration class that loads properties from external sources, such as property files or environment variables. When a class is annotated with `@PropertyConfiguration`, Spring will automatically load the specified properties and make them available for injection into other beans within the application context. This allows developers to externalize configuration settings, making it easier to manage and modify application properties without changing the code. The `@PropertyConfiguration` annotation is particularly useful in scenarios where different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) require different configuration settings, as it allows for easy switching between property sources based on the active profile. However, it's important to note that `@PropertyConfiguration` is not a standard annotation in Spring Framework; the commonly used annotation for loading properties is `@PropertySource`. The `@PropertySource` annotation is used to specify the location of property files to be loaded into the Spring environment.

Here is an example of how to use `@PropertySource` in a Spring configuration class:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.PropertySource;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;

@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")
public class AppConfig {
    @Value("${app.name}")
    private String appName;

    // Other bean definitions and configuration settings
}
```
In this example, the `AppConfig` class is annotated with `@PropertySource`, which specifies that the `application.properties` file located in the classpath should be loaded. The `@Value` annotation is then used to inject the value of the `app.name` property into the `appName` field.
