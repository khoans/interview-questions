# What is an Aspect in Spring?
An Aspect in Spring is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes, typically used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, transaction management, security, and caching. Aspects allow developers to separate these concerns from the main business logic, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
