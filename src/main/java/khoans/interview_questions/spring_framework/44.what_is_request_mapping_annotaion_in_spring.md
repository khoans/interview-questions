# What is @RequestMapping annotation in Spring Framework?
The `@RequestMapping` annotation in Spring Framework is used to map web requests to specific handler methods in a controller class. It is a versatile annotation that can be applied at both the class level and the method level to define the URL patterns, HTTP methods, request parameters, headers, and other attributes that a particular handler method should respond to.
