# Explain SQL Injection, CSRF, and XSS attacks.
SQL Injection, CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) are common web application security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of web applications.
1. SQL Injection:
- SQL Injection is a code injection technique that allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, data modification, or even deletion of data.
- Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's input validation and sanitization processes to execute arbitrary SQL commands

2. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):
- CSRF is an attack that tricks a user into performing actions on a web application without their consent. This is typically done by exploiting the user's authenticated session with the target application.
- Attackers create malicious links or forms that, when clicked or submitted by the user, send unauthorized requests to the target application, potentially leading to actions such as changing account settings, making purchases, or transferring funds.
- To prevent CSRF attacks, developers can implement anti-CSRF tokens, which are unique tokens included in forms and verified on the server side.

3. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):
- XSS is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can be executed in the context of the victim's browser, leading to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- There are three main types of XSS attacks: Stored XSS (where the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server), Reflected XSS (where the script is reflected off a web server, typically in an error message or search result), and DOM-based XSS (where the vulnerability exists in the client-side code).
- To mitigate XSS attacks, developers can implement input validation, output encoding, and use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the execution of untrusted scripts.
In summary, SQL Injection, CSRF, and XSS are serious security threats that can compromise web applications. Developers must implement robust security measures to protect against these vulnerabilities and ensure the safety of their users' data.
