# How can we check if an object is in persistent, detached, or transient state in Hibernate?

In Hibernate, you can check the state of an object (persistent, detached, or transient) by using the `Session` interface
methods. Here are the ways to determine the state of an object:

1. **Transient State**: An object is in a transient state if it has been created using the `new` operator but has not
   yet been associated with a Hibernate `Session`. You can check if an object is transient by verifying that it is not
   associated with any session and does not have a corresponding record in the database.

   ```java
   Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
   MyEntity entity = new MyEntity(); // Transient state
   boolean isTransient = !session.contains(entity); // true
   ```

2. **Persistent State**: An object is in a persistent state if it is associated with a Hibernate `Session` and has a
   corresponding record in the database. You can check if an object is persistent by using the `contains()` method of
   the `Session` interface.

   ```java
   Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
   MyEntity entity = session.get(MyEntity.class, id); // Persistent state
   boolean isPersistent = session.contains(entity); // true
   ```

3. **Detached State**: An object is in a detached state if it was previously associated with a Hibernate `Session` but
   is no longer associated with any session (e.g., after the session has been closed). You can check if an object is
   detached by verifying that it is not contained in the current session but has a corresponding record in the database.

   ```java
   Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
   MyEntity entity = session.get(MyEntity.class, id); // Persistent state
   session.close(); // Now the entity is detached
   boolean isDetached = !session.contains(entity); // true
   ```

By using these methods, you can effectively determine the state of an object in Hibernate.
