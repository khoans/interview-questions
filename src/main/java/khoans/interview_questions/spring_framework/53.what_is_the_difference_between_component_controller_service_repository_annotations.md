# What is the difference between @Component, @Controller, @Service, and @Repository annotations in Spring Framework?
In Spring Framework, `@Component`, `@Controller`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` are all stereotype annotations used to define beans in the application context. However, they serve different purposes and indicate different roles within the application architecture:
1. `@Component`:
   - This is a generic stereotype annotation that indicates that a class is a Spring-managed component.
   - It is the base annotation for all other stereotype annotations.
   - It can be used for any Spring bean that does not fit into the other specific categories.
2. `@Controller`:
   - This annotation is specifically used to define a controller in a Spring MVC application.
   - It is used to handle HTTP requests and return responses, typically in web applications.
   - Classes annotated with `@Controller` are responsible for processing user input, interacting with the service layer, and returning views or data.
3. `@Service`:
   - This annotation is used to define a service layer component in the application.
   - It indicates that the class contains business logic and is responsible for processing data and coordinating between the controller and repository layers.
   - Using `@Service` helps to clearly separate business logic from other layers of the application.
4. `@Repository`:
   - This annotation is used to define a data access layer component in the application.
   - It indicates that the class is responsible for interacting with the database or other data sources.
   - Classes annotated with `@Repository` typically contain methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and data retrieval.
   - Additionally, `@Repository` provides exception translation, converting database-specific exceptions into Spring's DataAccessException hierarchy.
In summary, while all four annotations are used to define Spring beans, they serve different roles in the application architecture: `@Component` is a generic component, `@Controller` is for handling web requests, `@Service` is for business logic, and `@Repository` is for data access. Using these specific annotations helps to improve the organization and clarity of the codebase. But they can technically be used interchangeably since they are all specializations of `@Component`.
