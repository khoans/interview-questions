# What is @Autowired annotation?
The `@Autowired` annotation in Spring Framework is used for automatic dependency injection. It allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into a bean during the application context initialization. When you annotate a field, constructor, or setter method with `@Autowired`, Spring will automatically find the appropriate bean from the application context and inject it into the annotated location.
