# What is Primary and Qualifier annotation in Spring Framework?
In Spring Framework, the `@Primary` and `@Qualifier` annotations are used to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type are present in the application context.
- `@Primary`: This annotation is used to indicate that a specific bean should be given preference when multiple beans of the same type are available for dependency injection. When a bean is marked with `@Primary`, it will be selected by default unless another bean is explicitly specified using `@Qualifier`. This is useful when you have a common implementation that you want to use as the default choice.
- `@Qualifier`: This annotation is used to specify which bean should be injected when there are multiple beans of the same type. By using `@Qualifier`, you can provide a specific identifier (name or value) to distinguish between different beans. This allows you to explicitly choose which bean to inject, overriding the default behavior of `@Primary`.
