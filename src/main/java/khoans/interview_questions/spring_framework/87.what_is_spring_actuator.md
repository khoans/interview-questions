# What is Spring Actuator?
Spring Actuator is a powerful module within the Spring Boot framework that provides production-ready features to help monitor and manage Spring Boot applications. It offers a set of built-in endpoints that expose various metrics, health checks, and other useful information about the application. These endpoints can be accessed via HTTP or JMX, allowing developers and system administrators to gain insights into the application's performance, resource usage, and overall health.
