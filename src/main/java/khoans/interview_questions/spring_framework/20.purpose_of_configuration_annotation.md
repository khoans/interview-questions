# Purpose of @Configuration Annotation in Spring Framework
The `@Configuration` annotation in Spring Framework is used to indicate that a class declares one or more `@Bean` methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime. It serves as a configuration class that replaces traditional XML-based configuration files.
