# What is @Required annotation in Spring Framework?
The `@Required` annotation in Spring Framework is used to indicate that a particular bean property must be set during the configuration of a Spring bean. When a property is annotated with `@Required`, the Spring container will ensure that the property is provided with a value; otherwise, it will throw a `BeanInitializationException` during the bean initialization process.
This annotation is typically applied to setter methods of bean properties. It is a way to enforce mandatory dependencies for a bean, ensuring that the necessary configuration is in place before the bean is used.

Here is an example of how to use the `@Required` annotation:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Required;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
@Component
public class MyBean {
    private String importantProperty;
    @Required
    public void setImportantProperty(String importantProperty) {
        this.importantProperty = importantProperty;
    }
    public String getImportantProperty() {
        return importantProperty;
    }
}
```
In this example, the `importantProperty` must be set for the `MyBean` class. If it is not set in the Spring configuration, an exception will be thrown during the initialization of the bean.
It's important to note that the `@Required` annotation has been deprecated as of Spring 5.1, and it is recommended to use constructor injection or other validation mechanisms to enforce required properties instead.
