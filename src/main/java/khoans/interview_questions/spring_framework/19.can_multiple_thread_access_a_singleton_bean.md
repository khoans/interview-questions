# Can multiple threads access a singleton bean in Spring Framework?
Yes, multiple threads can access a singleton bean in Spring Framework. By default, Spring beans are singleton-scoped, meaning that only one instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire application context. This single instance can be accessed by multiple threads concurrently. However, it's important to note that while the singleton scope allows for shared access, it does not inherently provide thread safety. If the singleton bean maintains mutable state, developers need to ensure proper synchronization or use thread-safe constructs to prevent concurrent access issues. For stateless beans or beans that do not maintain shared state, concurrent access is generally safe and does not require additional synchronization.
