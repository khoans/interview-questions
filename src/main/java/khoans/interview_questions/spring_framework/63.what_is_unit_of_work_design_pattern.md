# What is Unit of Work Design Pattern?
The Unit of Work design pattern is a software design pattern that helps manage and coordinate changes to a set of objects in a single transaction. It is commonly used in applications that interact with databases or other data sources to ensure that all changes made to the objects are consistent and can be committed or rolled back as a single unit. The main idea behind the Unit of Work pattern is to keep track of all the changes made to the objects during a business transaction and to coordinate the writing of these changes to the data store in an efficient manner.
