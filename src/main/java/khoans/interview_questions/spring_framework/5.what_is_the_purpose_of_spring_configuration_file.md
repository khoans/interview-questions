# What is the purpose of Spring configuration file?
- The purpose of a Spring configuration file is to define and manage the beans and their dependencies within a Spring application. It serves as a central place to configure the application's components, allowing developers to specify how objects are created, wired together, and managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
