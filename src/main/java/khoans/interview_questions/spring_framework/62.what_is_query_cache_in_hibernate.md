# What is Query Cache in Hibernate?
Query Cache in Hibernate is a caching mechanism that stores the results of database queries to improve application performance by reducing the number of database hits for frequently executed queries. When a query is executed, Hibernate checks if the result is already present in the query cache. If it is, Hibernate retrieves the result from the cache instead of executing the query against the database again. This can significantly reduce the load on the database and improve response times for read-heavy applications.

To use Query Cache in Hibernate, you need to enable it in your Hibernate configuration and annotate the queries that you want to cache. Hibernate provides two levels of caching: first-level cache (session cache) and second-level cache. The Query Cache is part of the second-level cache and works in conjunction with it.

Here are the key steps to enable and use Query Cache in Hibernate:
1. **Enable Second-Level Cache**: In your Hibernate configuration file (hibernate.cfg.xml or application.properties), enable the second-level cache by setting the appropriate properties.
2. **Enable Query Cache**: Set the property to enable the query cache specifically.
3. **Annotate Queries**: Use the `@Cacheable` annotation or set the cache mode for specific queries to indicate that their results should be cached.
4. **Configure Cache Provider**: Choose and configure a cache provider (e.g., Ehcache, Infinispan) to manage the cached data.
