# What is weaving in Spring AOP?
Weaving in Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) refers to the process of integrating aspects into the main application code. Aspects are modular units of cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, or transaction management, that can be applied to multiple points in an application.
Weaving can occur at different stages of the application lifecycle:
1. **Compile-time Weaving**: This occurs during the compilation of the source code. The aspects are woven into the code before the application is run. This method requires a special compiler that understands AOP constructs.
2. **Load-time Weaving**: This occurs when the classes are loaded into the Java
3. Virtual Machine (JVM). A special class loader is used to weave the aspects into the classes as they are loaded. Spring supports load-time weaving through the use of the `@EnableLoadTimeWeaving` annotation and a Java agent.
4. **Runtime Weaving**: This occurs while the application is running. Spring AOP primarily uses runtime weaving through proxy-based AOP. In this approach, Spring creates proxy objects that wrap the target objects, allowing aspects to be applied dynamically at runtime.
Weaving is a crucial part of AOP as it enables the separation of cross-cutting concerns from the main business logic, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. In Spring AOP, weaving is typically achieved using proxies, which intercept method calls and apply the relevant aspects as needed.
