# What are the components when implementing WebSocket in Spring Boot?

When implementing WebSocket in Spring Boot, several key components are involved to facilitate real-time communication between the client and server. These components include:
1. **WebSocket Configuration**: This component is responsible for configuring the WebSocket endpoints and settings. It typically involves creating a configuration class that extends `WebSocketConfigurer` and overrides the `registerWebSocketHandlers` method to register WebSocket handlers and define endpoint URLs.
2. **WebSocket Handler**: This component handles the WebSocket messages sent by clients. It implements the `WebSocketHandler` interface or extends the `TextWebSocketHandler` or `BinaryWebSocketHandler` classes to process incoming messages and send responses back to clients.
3. **Message Broker**: In cases where you want to use a publish-subscribe model, a message broker is used to route messages between clients and the server. Spring Boot supports using simple in-memory message brokers or external brokers like RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ.
4. **STOMP Protocol**: Spring Boot supports the STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) protocol for WebSocket communication. This allows clients to send and receive messages in a structured way, enabling features like subscriptions and message destinations.
5. **Client-Side Implementation**: On the client side, you need to implement WebSocket support using JavaScript or a WebSocket library. This involves creating a WebSocket connection to the server endpoint, sending messages, and handling incoming messages.
6. **Security Configuration**: If your application requires secure WebSocket communication, you may need to configure security settings using Spring Security. to protect WebSocket endpoints and manage authentication and authorization.
7. **Controller (Optional)**: In some cases, you may also have a controller component that handles HTTP requests related to WebSocket functionality, such as serving the initial HTML page that establishes the WebSocket connection.
Overall, these components work together to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server using WebSocket in a Spring Boot application.
