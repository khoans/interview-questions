# First Level of Cache and Second Level of Cache in Spring Framework
In Spring Framework, particularly in the context of Hibernate or JPA (Java Persistence API), caching is an important mechanism to improve application performance by reducing the number of database hits. There are two main levels of caching: First Level Cache and Second Level Cache.
1. First Level Cache:
- The First Level Cache is associated with the Hibernate Session or EntityManager. It is enabled by default and is specific to a particular session or transaction.
- Each time an entity is loaded or queried within a session, it is stored in the First Level Cache. If the same entity is requested again within the same session, Hibernate retrieves it from the cache instead of querying the database again.
- The First Level Cache is not shared across different sessions. Once the session is closed, the cache is cleared.
- It helps to reduce the number of database queries within a single transaction, improving performance.
2. Second Level Cache:
- The Second Level Cache is a shared cache that is associated with the SessionFactory or EntityManagerFactory. It is optional and needs to be explicitly configured.
- The Second Level Cache can store entities, collections, and query results. It is shared across multiple sessions and transactions.
- When an entity is requested, Hibernate first checks the First Level Cache. If it is not found there, it then checks the Second Level Cache before querying the database.
- The Second Level Cache can be configured to use various caching providers, such as Ehcache, Infinispan, or Hazelcast.
- It helps to reduce database access across multiple sessions, improving overall application performance.
In summary, the First Level Cache is session-specific and helps to optimize database access within a single transaction, while the Second Level Cache is shared across sessions and helps to optimize database access across multiple transactions. Both caching levels play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of applications using Hibernate or JPA in the Spring Framework.
