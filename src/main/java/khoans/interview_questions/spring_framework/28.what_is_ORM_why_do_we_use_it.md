# What is ORM? Why do we use it?
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented programming concepts. It provides a way to map database tables to Java classes and database records to Java objects, enabling developers to work with data in a more intuitive and natural way.
We use ORM for several reasons:
1. **Abstraction**: ORM abstracts the underlying database interactions, allowing developers to work with high-level objects instead of writing complex SQL queries. This abstraction simplifies the development process and reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for database operations.
2. **Productivity**: ORM frameworks provide a set of tools and features that streamline database operations, such as automatic generation of SQL queries, caching, and transaction management. This leads to increased developer productivity and faster application development.
3. **Maintainability**: By using ORM, developers can focus on the business logic of the application rather than the intricacies of database interactions. This separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
4. **Portability**: ORM frameworks often support multiple database systems, allowing developers to switch between different databases with minimal changes to the codebase. This portability is beneficial for applications that may need to support different database backends.
5. **Object-Oriented Paradigm**: ORM allows developers to work with data in an object-oriented manner, which aligns with the principles of modern programming languages like Java. This makes it easier to model complex data relationships and leverage object-oriented design patterns.
Overall, ORM simplifies database interactions, improves developer productivity, and enhances the maintainability of applications by providing a more intuitive way to work with data using object-oriented programming concepts.

Without using ORM, it could lead to mismatches between the object-oriented design of the application and the relational structure of the database, resulting in complex and error-prone code. Developers would need to write extensive SQL queries for data manipulation, leading to increased development time and potential for bugs. Additionally, without ORM, managing relationships between entities, handling transactions, and ensuring data consistency would become more challenging, ultimately impacting the overall quality and maintainability of the application.
