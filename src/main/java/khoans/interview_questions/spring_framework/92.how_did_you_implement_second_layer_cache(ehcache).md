# How did you implement second layer cache( Ehcache )?
To implement a second layer cache using Ehcache in a Spring Framework application with Hibernate, you can follow these steps:
1. **Add Dependencies**: First, you need to add the necessary dependencies for Ehcache and Hibernate in your `pom.xml` (for Maven) or `build.gradle` (for Gradle) file.
2. **Configure Ehcache**: Create an `ehcache.xml` configuration file to define the cache settings, such as cache names, time-to-live, max entries, etc.
3. **Enable Second Level Cache in Hibernate**: In your Hibernate configuration, enable the second level cache and specify Ehcache as the caching provider.
4. **Annotate Entities**: Use the `@Cache` annotation on your entity classes to specify which entities should be cached and the cache concurrency strategy.
5. **Configure Spring**: Ensure that your Spring configuration is set up to support Hibernate and Ehcache integration.
