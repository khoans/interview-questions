# Websocket vs HTTP
WebSocket and HTTP are both communication protocols used in web applications, but they have different characteristics and use cases.
1. **Protocol Type**:
   - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a request-response protocol where the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data. Each request is independent, and a new connection is established for each request.
   - WebSocket is a full-duplex communication protocol that allows for persistent connections between the client and server. Once a WebSocket connection is established, both the client and server can send and receive messages at any time without the need for repeated requests.
2. **Connection Persistence**:
   - HTTP connections are typically short-lived and are closed after the server responds to a request.
   - WebSocket connections are long-lived and remain open until explicitly closed by either the client or server.
3. **Data Transfer**:
   - HTTP is primarily designed for transferring text-based data (e.g., HTML, JSON, XML) and is optimized for request-response interactions.
   - WebSocket supports both text and binary data transfer, making it suitable for real-time applications that require low latency and high-frequency data exchange.
4. **Use Cases**:
   - HTTP is commonly used for traditional web applications, RESTful APIs, and scenarios where data is requested infrequently.
   - WebSocket is ideal for real-time applications such as chat applications, online gaming, live sports updates, and collaborative tools where continuous data exchange is required.
5. **Overhead**:
   - HTTP has higher overhead due to the need to establish a new connection for each request and response.
   - WebSocket has lower overhead after the initial handshake, as the connection remains open for ongoing communication.
In summary, HTTP is suitable for traditional web interactions with infrequent data exchange, while WebSocket is designed for real-time, bidirectional communication with low latency. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the application being developed.
