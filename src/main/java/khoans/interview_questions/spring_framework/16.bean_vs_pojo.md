# Bean vs POJO in Spring Framework
In the context of the Spring Framework, it's important to understand the distinction between a Bean and a POJO (Plain Old Java Object).
## POJO (Plain Old Java Object)
A POJO is a simple Java object that does not adhere to any special restrictions or frameworks. It is a term used to emphasize that the object is not bound by any specific Java EE or Spring framework conventions. POJOs are characterized by:
- No special annotations or interfaces.
- Simple structure, typically with private fields and public getters/setters.
- Can be used in any Java application without dependency on a specific framework.

## Bean in Spring Framework
A Bean in the Spring Framework is a specific type of POJO that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Beans are created, configured, and managed by Spring, and they can be defined in various ways, such as through XML configuration files, Java annotations, or Java-based configuration classes. Key characteristics of Spring Beans include:
- Managed by the Spring IoC container.
- Can be configured with various scopes (singleton, prototype, request, session, etc.).
- Can have lifecycle callbacks (initialization and destruction methods).
- Can be injected with dependencies using Spring's Dependency Injection (DI) mechanism.

A bean must have a default constructor or a constructor with arguments that can be resolved by the Spring container. Additionally, beans can be annotated with Spring-specific annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` to indicate their roles within the application.
