# What is an Advice in Spring AOP?
In Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), an "Advice" is a piece of code that defines the action to be taken at a specific join point in the application. It represents the actual behavior that is executed when a certain condition is met, such as before or after a method execution.


## Difference between Advice and Aspect
- **Advice**: Advice is the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. It defines what should be done (e.g., logging, security checks) when a specific event occurs in the application. There are different types of advice, such as "before," "after," and "around" advice.
- **Aspect**: An aspect is a modular unit that encapsulates a concern that cuts across multiple classes or methods. It is a combination of pointcuts and advice. An aspect defines where (pointcuts) and what (advice) should be applied in the application.
