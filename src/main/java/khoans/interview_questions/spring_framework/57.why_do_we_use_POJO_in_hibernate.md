# Why do we use POJO in Hibernate?
POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is used in Hibernate for several reasons:
1. **Simplicity**: POJOs are simple Java objects that do not depend on any specific framework or library. This simplicity makes it easier to create, read, update, and delete objects without the need for complex configurations or dependencies.
2. **Flexibility**: POJOs can be easily modified and extended without affecting the underlying database schema. This flexibility allows developers to adapt their object models as the application evolves.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Using POJOs allows developers to separate the business logic from the persistence logic. This separation makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
4. **Ease of Testing**: POJOs can be easily tested using standard unit testing frameworks without the need for a database connection. This makes it easier to write and run tests, leading to better code quality.
5. **Compatibility with Java Standards**: POJOs adhere to standard Java conventions, making them compatible with various Java frameworks and libraries. This compatibility allows for seamless integration with other components of the application.
6. **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: Hibernate can automatically map POJOs to database tables, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required for database operations. This leads to cleaner and more concise code.
Overall, using POJOs in Hibernate enhances the development experience by providing a simple, flexible, and maintainable way to work with persistent data in Java applications.
