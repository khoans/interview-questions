# Structure of a JWT Token
A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. A JWT is composed of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature. These parts are separated by dots (.) and encoded using Base64Url encoding.
The structure of a JWT token looks like this:

```
header.payload.signature
```
1. **Header**: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token (which is JWT) and the signing algorithm being used (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA). The header is a JSON object that is Base64Url encoded.
   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "alg": "HS256",
     "typ": "JWT"
   }
   ```
2. **Payload**: The payload contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims. The payload is also a JSON object that is Base64Url encoded.
   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "1234567890", // Subject (user ID)
     "name": "John Doe",
     "iat": 1516239022 // Issued at (timestamp)
   }
   ```
3. **Signature**: To create the signature part, you take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that. The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.
   Example (using HMAC SHA256):
   ```
   HMACSHA256(
     base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
     base64UrlEncode(payload),
     secret
   )
   ```
When you put all three parts together, you get a JWT token that looks like this:
```eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c```
This JWT token can be used for authentication and information exchange in web applications.
