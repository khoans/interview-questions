# What are the different scopes of a bean?

In Spring Framework, a bean can have different scopes that determine the lifecycle and visibility of the bean within the
application context. The most commonly used bean scopes are:

1. **Singleton**: This is the default scope. A singleton-scoped bean is created only once per Spring IoC container, and
   the same instance is shared across the entire application. This means that every request for the bean will return the
   same instance.
2. **Prototype**: A prototype-scoped bean is created each time it is requested from the Spring IoC container. This means
   that every request for the bean will return a new instance. Prototype scope is useful when you need multiple
   instances of a bean with different states.
3. **Request**: A request-scoped bean is created for each HTTP request in a web application. The bean is tied to the
   lifecycle of the HTTP request, meaning it is created when the request starts and destroyed when the request ends.
   This scope is useful for web applications where you want to maintain state for the duration of a single request.
4. **Session**: A session-scoped bean is created for each HTTP session in a web application. The bean is tied to the
   lifecycle of the HTTP session, meaning it is created when the session starts and destroyed when the session ends.
   This scope is useful for maintaining user-specific data across multiple requests within the same session.
5. **Application**: An application-scoped bean is created once per ServletContext in a web application. This means that
   the bean is shared across all users and requests within the same web application. This scope is useful for storing
   application-wide data.
6. **WebSocket**: A WebSocket-scoped bean is created for each WebSocket session. The bean is tied to the lifecycle of
   the WebSocket session, meaning it is created when the WebSocket connection is established and destroyed when the
   connection is closed.
   To define the scope of a bean in Spring, you can use the `@Scope` annotation along with the desired scope value. For
   example:
