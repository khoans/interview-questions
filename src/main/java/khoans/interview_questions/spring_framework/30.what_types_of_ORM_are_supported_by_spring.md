# What types of ORM are supported by Spring?
Spring Framework supports several Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, allowing developers to choose the one that best fits their needs. Some of the most commonly supported ORM frameworks in Spring include:
1. **Hibernate**: One of the most popular ORM frameworks, Hibernate provides a powerful and flexible way to map Java objects to database tables. Spring offers comprehensive support for Hibernate, including integration with Spring's transaction management and data access abstractions.
2. **Java Persistence API (JPA)**: JPA is a standard specification for ORM in Java. Spring provides support for JPA through its `spring-orm` module, allowing developers to use JPA implementations such as Hibernate, EclipseLink, and OpenJPA seamlessly within Spring applications.
3. **MyBatis**: MyBatis is a lightweight ORM framework that focuses on SQL mapping. Spring provides integration with MyBatis through the `mybatis-spring` module, allowing developers to use MyBatis in a Spring application with ease.
4. **EclipseLink**: EclipseLink is another JPA implementation supported by Spring. It offers advanced features such as caching and performance optimization, and can be easily integrated into Spring applications using the JPA support provided by Spring.
5. **OpenJPA**: OpenJPA is an open-source JPA implementation that is also supported by Spring. Developers can use OpenJPA in their Spring applications through the JPA integration provided by Spring.
Overall, Spring Framework provides robust support for various ORM frameworks, allowing developers to choose the one that best suits their application's requirements while benefiting from Spring's powerful features and abstractions.
6. **Spring Data JPA**: Spring Data JPA is a part of the larger Spring Data project that simplifies the implementation of JPA-based repositories. It provides a higher-level abstraction over JPA, allowing developers to create repository interfaces with minimal boilerplate code. Spring Data JPA supports various JPA providers, including Hibernate, EclipseLink, and OpenJPA, making it easier to work with ORM in Spring applications.
