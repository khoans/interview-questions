# What is a Role & a Principal in Spring Security? Give Example.
In Spring Security, a "Role" and a "Principal" are two important concepts related to authentication and authorization.
1. Role:
- A Role represents a specific authority or permission that a user can have within an application. Roles are typically used to define what actions a user is allowed to perform. For example, common roles might include "ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN", or "ROLE_MANAGER". Roles are usually prefixed with "ROLE_" to distinguish them from other types of authorities.
- In Spring Security, roles are often assigned to users during the authentication process and are used to control access to specific resources or functionalities within the application.
2. Principal:
- A Principal represents the currently authenticated user in the application. It is an object that contains information about the user, such as their username, password, and granted authorities (roles). The Principal is typically an instance of the `UserDetails` interface or a custom implementation of it.
- The Principal is used by Spring Security to identify the user and determine their access rights based on their assigned roles.
