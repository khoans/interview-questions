# Spring MVC Architecture
Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a web application framework that follows the MVC design pattern. It is part of the Spring Framework and provides a structured way to build web applications by separating concerns into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. Below is an overview of the Spring MVC architecture:
1. **Model**: The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for managing the data, processing user input, and interacting with the database or other data sources. In Spring MVC, the Model is typically represented by Java classes (POJOs) and can be managed using Spring's data access features, such as Spring Data JPA or Hibernate.
2. **View**: The View is responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting data to the user. In Spring MVC, views can be created using various technologies, such as JSP, Thymeleaf, or FreeMarker. The View component receives data from the Controller and generates the HTML or other formats to be sent to the client's browser.
3. **Controller**: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles incoming HTTP requests, processes user input, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and selects the appropriate View to render the response. In Spring MVC, Controllers are typically implemented as Java classes annotated with `@Controller` or `@RestController`.
4. **DispatcherServlet**: The DispatcherServlet is the central component of the Spring MVC architecture. It acts as the front controller, receiving all incoming HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate Controller based on the request URL and HTTP method. The DispatcherServlet is configured in the web application's deployment descriptor (web.xml) or through Java-based configuration.
5. **HandlerMapping**: The HandlerMapping component is responsible for mapping incoming requests to the appropriate Controller methods. It uses annotations (e.g., `@RequestMapping`) or XML configuration to define the mapping between URLs and Controller methods.
6. **ViewResolver**: The ViewResolver component is responsible for resolving the logical view names returned by Controllers into actual View implementations. It determines which View technology to use (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf) and locates the corresponding view files.
7. **ModelAndView**: The ModelAndView class is used to encapsulate both the Model data and the View name. Controllers can return a ModelAndView object to provide data to the View along with the name of the View to be rendered.
Overall, the Spring MVC architecture provides a clean and modular way to build web applications by separating concerns into distinct components. This separation allows for easier maintenance, testing, and scalability of web applications.
