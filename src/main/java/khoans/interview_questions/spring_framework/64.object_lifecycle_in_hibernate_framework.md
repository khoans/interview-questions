# Object Lifecycle in Hibernate Framework
In Hibernate, the object lifecycle refers to the different states that a persistent object can go through during its existence in relation to the Hibernate session and the underlying database. There are four main states in the Hibernate object lifecycle:
1. **Transient State**: An object is in the transient state when it is created using the `new` operator but is not yet associated with a Hibernate session. In this state, the object is not persistent, meaning it is not stored in the database. Transient objects do not have a corresponding record in the database, and they are not managed by Hibernate.
2. **Persistent State**: An object enters the persistent state when it is associated with a Hibernate session. This can happen when the object is saved or updated using methods like `session.save()`, `session.persist()`, or `session.update()`. In this state, the object is managed by Hibernate, and any changes made to the object will be automatically synchronized with the database when the session is flushed or committed.
3. **Detached State**: An object is in the detached state when it was previously in the persistent state but is no longer associated with a Hibernate session. This can happen when the session is closed or when the object is explicitly evicted from the session using methods like `session.evict()`. Detached objects still have a corresponding record in the database, but they are not managed by Hibernate. Changes made to detached objects will not be automatically synchronized with the database unless the object is reattached to a session using methods like `session.update()` or `session.merge()`.
4. **Removed State**: An object enters the removed state when it is marked for deletion from the database. This can happen when the object is deleted using methods like `session.delete()`. In this state, the object is still associated with the Hibernate session, but it is scheduled for removal from the database. The actual deletion occurs when the session is flushed or committed.
Understanding the object lifecycle in Hibernate is crucial for effectively managing persistent objects and ensuring that changes are correctly synchronized with the database. Proper handling of these states helps prevent issues such as stale data, unintended deletions, and inefficient database operations.
