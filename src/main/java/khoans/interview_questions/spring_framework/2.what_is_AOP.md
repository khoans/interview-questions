# What is AOP?
AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code (called "advice") without modifying the code itself, typically through a process called "weaving."

In AOP, the main concepts include:
1. **Aspect**: A module that encapsulates a concern that cuts across multiple classes or methods. For example, logging, security, or transaction management can be implemented as aspects.
2. **Join Point**: A specific point in the execution of the program, such as method execution or object instantiation, where an aspect can be applied.
3. **Advice**: The action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. There are different types of advice, such as "before," "after," and "around" advice.
4. **Pointcut**: A set of join points where an aspect's advice should be applied. Pointcuts define the conditions under which advice is executed.
5. **Weaving**: The process of applying aspects to a target object to create a new proxy object that includes the additional behavior defined by the aspects. Weaving can occur at compile-time, load-time, or runtime.

AOP is commonly used in frameworks like Spring AOP and AspectJ in the Java ecosystem to handle cross-cutting concerns in a clean and modular way, improving code maintainability and readability.
