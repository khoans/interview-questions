# What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is an open-source framework built on top of the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It provides a set of conventions and pre-configured settings that allow developers to quickly set up and run Spring applications with minimal configuration. Spring Boot aims to reduce the complexity of building and deploying Spring applications by providing a streamlined development experience.
Key features of Spring Boot include:
1. **Auto-Configuration**: Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to your project. This means that you can get started quickly without having to write extensive configuration code.
2. **Starter Dependencies**: Spring Boot provides a set of "starter" dependencies that bundle commonly used libraries and frameworks together. This makes it easy to add functionality to your application by simply including the appropriate starter dependency in your build configuration.
3. **Embedded Servers**: Spring Boot includes embedded web servers (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) that allow you to run your application as a standalone Java application without the need for an external application server.
4. **Production-Ready Features**: Spring Boot includes features that are essential for production applications, such as health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration. These features help you monitor and manage your application in a production environment.
5. **Spring Boot CLI**: Spring Boot provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to quickly create and run Spring Boot applications using Groovy scripts.
Overall, Spring Boot simplifies the development process by providing sensible defaults and reducing the amount of boilerplate code required to set up a Spring application. It is widely used for building microservices and web applications due to its ease of use and rapid development capabilities.
