# What is DispatcherServlet in Spring Framework?
The `DispatcherServlet` is a core component of the Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. It acts as the front controller in a Spring web application, handling all incoming HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate handlers (controllers) for processing. The `DispatcherServlet` is responsible for coordinating the entire request processing workflow, including:
1. **Request Handling**: It receives incoming HTTP requests and determines which controller should handle the request based on the URL mapping.
2. **Handler Mapping**: It uses handler mappings to find the appropriate controller method that can process the request.
3. **Controller Invocation**: It invokes the selected controller method, passing any necessary request parameters.
4. **View Resolution**: After the controller processes the request and returns a model and view, the `DispatcherServlet` uses view resolvers to determine which view (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf template) should be rendered.
5. **Response Rendering**: Finally, it renders the view and sends the HTTP response back to the client.
Overall, the `DispatcherServlet` serves as the central dispatcher for handling web requests in a Spring MVC application, providing a clean separation of concerns between the different components involved in request processing.
