# What are different types of the transaction management supported by Spring Framework?
Spring Framework supports two main types of transaction management:
1. Programmatic Transaction Management:
   - In programmatic transaction management, developers explicitly manage transactions in their code using the `PlatformTransactionManager` interface provided by Spring. This approach gives developers fine-grained control over transaction boundaries, allowing them to start, commit, or roll back transactions as needed.
   - Example:
     ```java
     TransactionStatus status = transactionManager.getTransaction(new DefaultTransactionDefinition());
     try {
         // business logic here
         transactionManager.commit(status);
     } catch (Exception e) {
         transactionManager.rollback(status);
     }
     ```
2. Declarative Transaction Management:
   - Declarative transaction management allows developers to define transaction boundaries using annotations or XML configuration, without the need to write explicit transaction management code. Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is used to apply transaction management aspects to the specified methods or classes.
   - The most common way to implement declarative transaction management is by using the `@Transactional` annotation.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @Transactional
     public void someBusinessMethod() {
         // business logic here
     }
     ```
Both types of transaction management can be used in Spring applications, and developers can choose the approach that best fits their needs. Declarative transaction management is generally preferred for its simplicity and ease of use, while programmatic transaction management is useful for scenarios that require more complex transaction handling.
