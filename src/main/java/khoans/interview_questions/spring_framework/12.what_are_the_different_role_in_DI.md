# What are the different roles in Dependency Injection (DI)?
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. In DI, there are several key roles involved:
1. **Client**: The client is the class that depends on other classes (dependencies) to perform its functions. It does not create or manage its dependencies directly but relies on an external source to provide them.
2. **Service/Dependency**: The service or dependency is the class that provides specific functionality that the client requires. It is the object that is injected into the client.
3. **Injector/DI Container**: The injector or DI container is responsible for creating and managing the lifecycle of the dependencies. It is responsible for injecting the required dependencies into the client. The DI container typically uses configuration metadata (such as XML, annotations, or code) to determine how to create and inject the dependencies.
4. **Configuration**: The configuration defines how the dependencies are wired together. This can be done through various means, such as XML configuration files, annotations, or programmatic configuration using code. The configuration specifies which implementations of the dependencies should be used and how they should be injected into the client.
5. **Factory**: In some DI implementations, a factory may be used to create instances of the dependencies. The factory encapsulates the logic for creating the dependencies and can be used by the DI container to obtain instances of the required services.
Overall, these roles work together to facilitate the process of dependency injection, allowing for greater flexibility, modularity, and testability in software applications.
