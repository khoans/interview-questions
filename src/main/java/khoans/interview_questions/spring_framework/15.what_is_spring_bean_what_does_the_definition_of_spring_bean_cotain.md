# What is Spring Bean? What does the definition of Spring Bean contain?
A Spring Bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. In the context of the Spring Framework, a bean is simply a Java object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring container. Beans are the fundamental building blocks of a Spring application, and they are typically defined in configuration files (XML or Java-based configuration) or through annotations.
