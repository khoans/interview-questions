# What is the purpose of Spring IOC container?
The purpose of the Spring Inversion of Control (IOC) container is to manage the lifecycle and configuration of application objects (beans) in a Spring application. It is a core component of the Spring Framework that facilitates dependency injection, allowing developers to create loosely coupled and easily testable applications. The IOC container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans based on the configuration metadata provided by the developer, either through XML configuration files, annotations, or Java-based configuration.
