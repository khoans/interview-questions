# How do you compile all the dependencies into a single jar file?
We use shade plugin to compile all the dependencies into a single jar file. The Maven Shade Plugin is a powerful tool that allows you to create an uber-jar (also known as a fat jar) that contains your application code along with all its dependencies bundled together. This is particularly useful for deploying standalone Java applications, as it simplifies the deployment process by reducing the number of required files.
