# What is Authentication Server?
An Authentication Server is a specialized server that is responsible for verifying the identity of users or systems attempting to access a network, application, or service. It plays a crucial role in the authentication process by validating credentials, such as usernames and passwords, and issuing authentication tokens or session identifiers upon successful verification. The Authentication Server typically supports various authentication methods, including password-based authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and biometric authentication. It may also integrate with identity management systems, such as LDAP or Active Directory, to manage user identities and access permissions. In addition to authentication, some Authentication Servers also provide authorization services, determining what resources or actions an authenticated user is allowed to access. Common examples of Authentication Servers include OAuth2 servers, OpenID Connect providers, and SAML identity providers. Overall, the Authentication Server is a critical component in ensuring secure access to systems and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
