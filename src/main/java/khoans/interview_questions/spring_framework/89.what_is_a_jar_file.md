# What is a JAR file?
A JAR (Java ARchive) file is a package file format used to aggregate multiple Java class files, associated metadata, and resources (such as images, text files, etc.) into a single file for distribution. JAR files are built on the ZIP file format and have a `.jar` file extension.
