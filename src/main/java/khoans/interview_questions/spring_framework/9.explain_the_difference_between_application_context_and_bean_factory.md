# What is the difference between ApplicationContext and BeanFactory?

The main differences between ApplicationContext and BeanFactory in the Spring Framework are as follows:

1. **Eager vs Lazy Initialization**:
    - **BeanFactory**: It uses lazy initialization, meaning that beans are created only when they are requested for the
      first time.
    - **ApplicationContext**: It uses eager initialization by default, meaning that all singleton beans are created at
      the time of context initialization.
    - This can lead to faster startup times with BeanFactory, but ApplicationContext ensures that all beans are ready
      for use when the application starts.

2. **Advanced Features**:
    - **BeanFactory**: It provides basic functionality for managing beans and their dependencies.
    - **ApplicationContext**: It extends BeanFactory and provides additional features such as internationalization
      support, event propagation, and support for various application contexts (e.g., WebApplicationContext for web
      applications).

3. **Integration with Spring Modules**:
    - **BeanFactory**: It is a more basic container and does not provide integration with other Spring modules.
    - **ApplicationContext**: It is designed to work seamlessly with other Spring modules, such as Spring MVC, Spring
      AOP, and Spring Data.

4. **Resource Loading**:
    - **BeanFactory**: It has limited support for resource loading.
    - **ApplicationContext**: It provides a more flexible and powerful resource loading mechanism, allowing for loading
      resources from various locations (e.g., classpath, filesystem, URLs).

5. **Event Handling**:

    - **BeanFactory**: It does not support event handling.
    - **ApplicationContext**: It supports event handling, allowing beans to publish and listen for application events by using the ApplicationEventPublisher interface and ApplicationListener interface. Or we can use the @EventListener annotation to handle events in a more declarative way.
