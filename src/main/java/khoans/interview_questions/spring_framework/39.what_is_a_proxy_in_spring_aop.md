# What is a Proxy in Spring AOP?
A proxy in Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is a special object that acts as an intermediary between a client and a target object. It is created by the Spring AOP framework to implement cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, or transaction management, without modifying the actual business logic of the target object.

When a method on the target object is invoked, the proxy intercepts the call and can execute additional behavior (advice) before or after the method execution. This allows developers to separate concerns and apply common functionality across multiple classes in a modular way.

Spring AOP supports two types of proxies:
1. **JDK Dynamic Proxies**: These proxies are created using Java's built-in proxy mechanism and can only proxy interfaces. If the target object implements one or more interfaces, Spring AOP will use JDK dynamic proxies by default.
2. **CGLIB Proxies**: These proxies are created using the CGLIB (Code Generation Library) and can proxy classes directly, even if they do not implement any interfaces. If the target object is a concrete class without interfaces, Spring AOP will use CGLIB proxies.
