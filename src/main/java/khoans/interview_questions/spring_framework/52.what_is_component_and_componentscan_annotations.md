# What is @Component and @ComponentScan annotations in Spring Framework?
The `@Component` and `@ComponentScan` annotations in Spring Framework are used for automatic detection and registration of beans in the Spring application context.

- `@Component`: This annotation is used to mark a Java class as a Spring component. When a class is annotated with `@Component`, it indicates that the class is a candidate for auto-detection and will be registered as a bean in the Spring application context. The `@Component` annotation can be applied to any class, and it is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. There are also specialized stereotypes like `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` that extend the functionality of `@Component` for specific use cases. Specifically:
    - `@Service`: Indicates that the class is a service component in the business layer.
    - `@Repository`: Indicates that the class is a data access component, typically interacting with a database.
    - `@Controller`: Indicates that the class is a web controller component, typically handling HTTP requests.
    - `@RestController`: A specialized version of `@Controller` that combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, used for RESTful web services.
    - `@Configuration`: Indicates that the class contains bean definitions and configuration settings for the Spring application context.
    - `@Bean`: Used within `@Configuration` classes to define individual beans.

- `@ComponentScan`: This annotation is used to specify the base packages to scan for components annotated with `@Component` (and its specialized stereotypes). When you use `@ComponentScan`, Spring will automatically discover and register all the classes annotated with `@Component` within the specified packages and their sub-packages. This eliminates the need for manual bean registration in XML configuration files. You can specify the base packages using the `basePackages` attribute of the `@ComponentScan` annotation. For example:
```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.myapp")
public class AppConfig {
    // Other bean definitions and configuration settings
}
```
