# What is WebApplicationContext in Spring MVC?
In Spring MVC, `WebApplicationContext` is a specialized version of the `ApplicationContext` that is designed to work in a web environment. It extends the standard `ApplicationContext` and provides additional functionality specific to web applications. The `WebApplicationContext` is responsible for managing the lifecycle of web-related beans, such as controllers, view resolvers, and handler mappings. It also provides access to web-specific resources, such as the `ServletContext`, which allows beans to interact with the underlying web container. The `WebApplicationContext` is typically created by the `DispatcherServlet`, which is the central servlet in a Spring MVC application. It is initialized when the `DispatcherServlet` is started and is used to handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate controllers. Overall, the `WebApplicationContext` plays a crucial role in enabling the integration of Spring's dependency injection and web functionalities, making it easier to develop web applications using the Spring MVC framework.
