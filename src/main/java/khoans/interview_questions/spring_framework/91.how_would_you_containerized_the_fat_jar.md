# How would you containerized the fat jar?
To containerize a fat jar (also known as an uber jar) using Docker, you can follow these steps:
1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the instructions for building the Docker image.

```Dockerfile
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app
# Copy the fat jar into the container at /app
COPY target/your-fat-jar-name.jar app.jar
# Expose the port that your application will run on
EXPOSE 8080
# Define the command to run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```
