# What is Hibernate Query Language (HQL)?
Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language used in Hibernate, a popular Java-based Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. HQL is similar to SQL (Structured Query Language) but is designed to work with Hibernate's entity objects rather than directly with database tables. HQL allows developers to write queries that are independent of the underlying database, making it easier to switch between different database systems without changing the query syntax.
