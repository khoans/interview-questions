# When to use Prototype Bean in Spring Framework
In Spring Framework, a Prototype Bean is used when you need a new instance of a bean every time it is requested from the Spring container. Unlike Singleton Beans, which are created once and shared across the application, Prototype Beans are created anew for each request. Here are some scenarios where you might want to use Prototype Beans:
1. **Stateful Beans**: If your bean maintains state that is specific to a particular user session or request, you should use a Prototype Bean. This ensures that each user gets their own instance of the bean, preventing state leakage between users.
2. **Short-lived Objects**: When you need objects that are short-lived and should be discarded after use, Prototype Beans are a good choice. This is common in scenarios like form backing objects in web applications.
3. **Resource-intensive Objects**: If the creation of a bean is resource-intensive and you want to avoid the overhead of reusing a single instance, using Prototype Beans can help. Each request will create a new instance, allowing for better resource management.
4. **Dynamic Configuration**: If the configuration of a bean needs to change dynamically based on the context of the request, Prototype Beans can be used to provide different configurations for each instance.
5. **Testing and Prototyping**: During development and testing, you may want to create multiple instances of a bean to test different scenarios. Prototype Beans facilitate this by allowing you to create new instances as needed.
To define a Prototype Bean in Spring, you can use the `@Scope` annotation with the value `ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE`:
