# What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications. A JWT is composed of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.
1. **Header**: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA). The header is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.
2. **Payload**: The payload contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered claims (predefined claims like `iss`, `exp`, `sub`, etc.), public claims (custom claims defined by the user), and private claims (custom claims shared between parties). The payload is also Base64Url encoded to form the second part of the JWT.
3. **Signature**: To create the signature, the encoded header and payload are combined with a secret key (or a private key in the case of asymmetric algorithms) and then signed using the specified algorithm. The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. The signature forms the third part of the JWT.
The final JWT is formed by concatenating the encoded header, payload, and signature with periods (.) as separators, resulting in a string that looks like this:
```
header.payload.signature
```
