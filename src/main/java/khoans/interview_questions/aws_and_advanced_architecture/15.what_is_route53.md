# What is Route 53?
Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to route end-user requests to internet applications by translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to connect to each other.
