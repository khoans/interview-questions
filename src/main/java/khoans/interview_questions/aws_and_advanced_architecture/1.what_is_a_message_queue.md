# What is a Message Queue?
A message queue is a communication mechanism used in distributed systems to facilitate asynchronous communication between different components or services. It allows messages to be sent from a producer (sender) to a consumer (receiver) without requiring both parties to be available at the same time. This decoupling of components helps improve system scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.
