# What is event driven architecture?
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern in which the flow of the program is determined by events, such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs. In an event-driven architecture, components of the system communicate with each other by producing and consuming events, rather than through direct method calls or function invocations. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and decoupling of components, as each component can operate independently and respond to events as they occur.
