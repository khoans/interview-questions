# What is the use of SQS and SNS?
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) are two distinct services provided by AWS that serve different purposes in building distributed and decoupled applications.
1. Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service):

- SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
- It allows you to send, store, and receive messages between software components without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available.
- SQS is used for asynchronous communication, where messages are stored in a queue until they are processed by a consumer.
- It supports two types of queues: Standard Queues (which offer high throughput and at-least-once delivery) and FIFO Queues (which ensure exactly-once processing and maintain the order of messages).
- Common use cases for SQS include task scheduling, load leveling, and decoupling of application components.

2. Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):
- SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to send messages to multiple subscribers or endpoints simultaneously.
- It allows you to publish messages to topics, which can then be delivered to various subscribers, such as email, SMS, HTTP/S endpoints, or other AWS services like SQS and Lambda.
- SNS is used for real-time communication and broadcasting messages to multiple recipients.
- It supports different protocols for message delivery, including email, SMS, mobile push notifications, and HTTP/S.
- Common use cases for SNS include sending notifications, alerts, and updates to users or systems.
In summary, SQS is used for decoupling and asynchronous communication between components, while SNS is used for broadcasting messages to multiple subscribers in real-time. Both services can be used together to create robust and scalable architectures in AWS.
