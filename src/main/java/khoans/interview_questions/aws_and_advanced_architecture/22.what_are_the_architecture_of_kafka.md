# What is the architecture of Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, low-latency data processing. Its architecture consists of several key components:
1. **Producers**: Producers are client applications that publish (write) data to Kafka topics. They send records to specific topics, which are logical channels for organizing data.
2. **Topics**: Topics are categories or feed names to which records are published. Each topic is divided into partitions, which allow for parallel processing and scalability. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records.
3. **Brokers**: Brokers are Kafka servers that store data and serve client requests. A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers, which work together to provide fault tolerance and load balancing.
4. **Consumers**: Consumers are client applications that subscribe to topics and read (consume) data from them. Consumers can be part of a consumer group, which allows for load balancing and parallel processing of records across multiple consumers.
5. **Zookeeper**: Zookeeper is a centralized service used by Kafka to manage configuration information, maintain cluster state, and coordinate distributed processes. It helps in leader election for partitions and keeps track of broker metadata.

6. **Partitions**: Each topic is divided into multiple partitions, which are distributed across brokers. Partitions enable Kafka to scale horizontally and allow multiple consumers to read from different partitions simultaneously.
7. **Replication**: Kafka provides data durability and fault tolerance through replication. Each partition can have multiple replicas stored on different brokers. If a broker fails, one of the replicas can take over as the leader for that partition.
8. **Leaders and Followers**: Each partition has one leader and multiple followers. The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition, while followers replicate the data from the leader to ensure data redundancy.
9. **Log Segments**: Kafka stores data in log segments, which are files on disk. Each partition is represented as a log, and new records are appended to the end of the log. This design allows for efficient sequential writes and reads.
10. **Retention Policies**: Kafka allows for configurable retention policies, which determine how long data is stored in topics. Data can be retained based on time (e.g., 7 days) or size (e.g., 1 GB), after which it is automatically deleted.
Overall, Kafka's architecture is designed to provide a scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-throughput platform for real-time data streaming and processing.
