# What is a distributed application?
A distributed application is a software system that consists of multiple interconnected components or services that run on different machines or nodes within a network. These components communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal or perform specific tasks. Distributed applications are designed to leverage the resources of multiple computers, allowing for improved scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.

Distributed applications can take various forms, including microservices architectures, client-server models, and peer-to-peer systems. They often rely on network protocols and communication mechanisms such as RESTful APIs, message queues, or remote procedure calls (RPC) to facilitate interaction between components.
