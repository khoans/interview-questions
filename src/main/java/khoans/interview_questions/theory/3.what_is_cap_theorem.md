# What is CAP Theorem?
The CAP Theorem, also known as Brewer's Theorem, is a fundamental principle in distributed systems that states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:
1. **Consistency (C)**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error. This means that all nodes in the distributed system see the same data at the same time.
2. **Availability (A)**: Every request (read or write) receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write. This means that the system is always available to respond to requests, even if some nodes are down.
3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes. This means that the system can handle network partitions, where some nodes cannot communicate with others
4. In practice, distributed systems can only guarantee two of the three properties at any given time. This leads to three possible combinations:
   - **CA (Consistency and Availability)**: Systems that prioritize consistency and availability may sacrifice partition tolerance. These systems work well in environments with reliable networks but may fail during network partitions.
   - **CP (Consistency and Partition Tolerance)**: Systems that prioritize consistency and partition tolerance may sacrifice availability. These systems ensure that data is consistent across nodes, but some requests may not be served during network partitions.
   - **AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance)**: Systems that prioritize availability and partition tolerance may sacrifice consistency. These systems ensure that requests are always served, but the data may not be consistent across nodes during network partitions.
The CAP Theorem is a crucial consideration for architects and developers when designing distributed systems, as it helps them understand the trade-offs involved in achieving different system properties.
